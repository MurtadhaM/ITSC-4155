My classes are designed to encourage students to look beyond what a text communicates overtly in the plot, focusing instead on how ideas are embedded and repeated as narrative patterns that are generally unconsciously produced by the author. Unearthing an author\u2019s implicit cultural biases enables us to learn more about the ways in which people related to the world around them during the time period in which the text was created.
