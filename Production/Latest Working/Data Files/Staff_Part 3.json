My interdisciplinary research looks at issues of consciousness, culture and identity in micro-mobilization processes among members of the African Diaspora, especially late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century enslaved people\u2019s rebellions. I specifically focus on the influence of African-inspired sacred rituals on oppositional consciousness and patterns of escape from enslavement before the Haitian Revolution. I rely heavily on archival data, including content analysis of digitally archived runaway slave advertisements. These allow me to ask questions about the role of race and ethnicity, gender, social ties, and forms of human and social capital used in runaways\u2019 attempts to liberate themselves. My research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the John Carter Brown Library, as well as the African American Intellectual History Society. I have conducted research at the national archives of France in Paris and Aix-en-Provence, the University of Florida at Gainesville, the Schomburg Center, as well as in Cap-Ha\u00eftien, Port-au-Prince, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, and Jacmel, Haiti. I have presented my work at national and international forums, such as the Notre Dame Center for the Study of Social Movements Young Scholars Conference; the Association for the Study of the Worldwide African Diaspora Biennial Conference; and the International Sociological Association World Congress of Sociology.

Currently I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I am concerned with the social and interactional production of difference, particularly in Oceania and the Pacific diaspora. My book,Talking Like Children: Language and the Production of Age in the Marshall Islands (Oxford University Press 2019) applies the significant advances in cultural and linguistic analyses of well-discussed forms of social differentiation\u2014such as gender and race\u2014to the relatively overlooked category of age. I argue that immaturity is cultural, not natural, and that Marshallese children are socialized to be different from their elders. I also show how a basic and central issue in anthropological theory and ethnography\u2014exchange in Oceania\u2014cannot be understood without attention to the life-course or children\u2014 revealing the relevance of age to anthropological theory. In both the book and several other publications, I apply my findings on interaction, age, and difference to the analysis of economics and exchange, kinship and adoption, and humanitarian campaigns to end corporal punishment. I am beginning a new project on language, age, and race in the Marshallese diaspora, and specifically in Springdale, Arkansas. This project asks (1) How are distinct Marshallese linguistic and cultural practices interpretedand transformed in school? and (2) What effect do these interactions have on Marshallese diasporaidentity?

Professor Starrett has conducted research on secularism, religious commodities, and public culture in Egypt; on African-American Muslim communities; on Islamophobia and ritual in multicultural education in the US; on the folklore of bioterrorism and suicide bombing; and most recently on the return of right-wing movements to political prominence in Western democracies.

As a member of mylab each student should achieve masteryof new biological lab techniques, an intellectual understanding of research questions and literature, and a feeling ofcollaboration and camaraderie through active learning.The lab team experiencepromotes success of both the students and the projects. Graduate and undergraduate students in my lab are expected to participate inresearchprojects as part of a team. No studentis singularly responsible for her/his ownpersonal project. Students help each other get experiments finished, troubleshoot problems, and analyze results for posters and publications.New students get to learn from the more senior students; senior students in turn test their understanding of concepts and protocolsby teachingthe new.Publications include all members of the team further promotingcollaboration as well as a sense of accomplishment by everyone. Students are expected toparticipate in weekly lab research progress meetings, journal clubs, and joint meetings with other University lab collaborators.   RESEARCH INTERESTS AND CURRENT LAB PROJECTS DNA repair and genome stability in mitotic cells using mouse models Although the role of homologous recombination (HR) to repair DNA damage is well appreciated in meiosis of prokaryotes, yeast, and metazoans. However the role of interchromosomal HR (between TWO different chromosomes) to occur in vivo in many different types ofcells of mammals is only minimally understood. It is importantto understand when interchromosomal HR can occur because it has the potential maintaingenome stability, and also drive genetic diversity and evolution, or even genome rearrangements leading to cancer. Our laboratory established unique mouse models using green fluorescent protein reporters (GFP) to determine the potential of DNA damage to promote HRin vivo. These models were the first to demonstrate that interchromosomal HR occurs in vivo in multiple organ systems, and provide an ideal platform to further elucidate which cells at specific developmental stages of development or differentiation may be most likely to undergo this type of DSB repair. Ourresearchwill lead to an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of DSB rejoining at the chromosomal level, and also provide insight on genome stability and genetic evolution. DNA damage-induced chromosomal rearrangements in leukemia The long-term objective of this researchis to understand the mechanisms used by hematopoietic (blood) cells to repair of one type of DNA damage \u2014 the double-strand break (DSB)\u2013 and the initial molecular events that lead to genomic rearrangements such as translocations, which are a hallmark of leukemias. DNA damaging agents are common therapy in the treatment of human cancers, but they also produce chromosomal rearrangements and oncogenic transformation and tumor formation. Recent data from my lab indicates that chromosomal rearrangements analogous to those observed in hematopoietic malignancies are readily formed during DSB repair in both human and mouse hematopoietic stem cell-enriched populations. My lab uses multiple genetic approaches in cultured cell lines and genetically engineered mice to identify the initial events that promote the formation of DNA damage-induced chromosomal rearrangements, and the cooperative mutations or predisposing factors that can promote (or suppress) transformation of cells that acquire them. There is a growing list of compounds in our daily life that promote or stabilize chromosomal DSBs and may lead to these chromosomal rearrangements. These include dietary supplements and environmental toxins including estrogens used as hormone supplements, bioflavonoids such as genistein and quercetin found in foods, soy products energy drinks and dietary supplements, quinones or benzenes found in paints and flame retardants used in homes andfurniture.Our research will provide an understanding of which of these can produce genome changes that may lead to leukemia and also determine if exposure in utero through maternal exposure may promote infant leukemia. tWe hope this researchmay lead to new approaches to prevention or therapy. Biomarkers of Ovarian Cancer Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is responsible for an estimated 21,800 new cases and 14,000 deaths each year. Overall, patients have a five-year survival rate of 30%-40%. The primary option of treatment is often invasive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and taxane (Paclitaxel) that lead to multiple systemic side effects and toxicity, limiting the doses physicians can use. Up to 80% of patients will eventually relapse and become platinum-taxane resistant. The overall goals of thisresearch are to (1) use genetic, genomic, and proteomic approaches to understand how altered proteins promote ovarian cancerand may act as biomarkers of susceptibility and disease, and (2) use knowledge about tumor specific characteristics or biomarkers to develop new targeted therapies.Our research used both bioinformatic approaches and proteomic approaches toidentifysignificant loss of HOXC6 in epithelial ovarian cancer in both the tumor itself and in the serum of patients with this cancer type. Archived Research : Targeted Nanoparticle-Aptamer Therapy of Ovarian Cancer Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is responsible for an estimated 21,800 new cases and 14,000 deaths each year. Overall, patients have a five-year survival rate of 30%-40%. The primary option of treatment is often invasive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and taxane (Paclitaxel) that lead to multiple systemic side effects and toxicity, limiting the doses physicians can use. Up to 80% of patients will eventually relapse and become platinum-taxane resistant. We identified single-stranded DNA aptamers a Cell-SELEX screen that we hypothesize will selectively associate with and internalize into ovarian cancercells but not other cells both in cultured cell lines and in a xenograft mouse model. Conjugation of the aptamers to polymer nanoparticles loaded with paclitaxel will be assessed for potential to promote in vivo targeting of platinum-based chemotherapeutics directly to tumor cells. In addition to potential translational outcomes, our studies will increase our understanding of the basic biologic characteristics of individual epithelial ovarian tumor cell membranes, aptamer association and internalization, and cellular response to aptamers and nanoparticles. This researchwill provide a significant new effective therapeutic approach to epithelial ovarian cancer treatment.

Awards  2014 Outstanding Faculty Award Multicultural Academic Service Award 2020 CLAS Excellence in Teaching: Integration of Undergraduate Teaching and Research Award  Research  The Research projects ongoing in Dr. Dr\u00e9au\u2019s laboratory focus on understanding the molecular, cellular, and physiological bases of metastases associated with cancers of epithelial origin. The cancers of epithelial origin include: the most lethal skin cancer, i.e. melanoma and the most common solid tumor in female i.e., breast cancer. In these cancers as in others, the occurrence of metastases is associated with a high mortality (see the site of the American Cancer Society for details on cancer statistics in the US: http://www.cancer.org) The development of metastases is a multi-step process, which, from the tumor standpoint, includes:  Development of tumor cells with metastatic potentials. Detachment, migration of tumor cells generally through the vascular system (blood, lymph vessels), and anchoring within the host tissue. Growth of the metastatic mass requiring the concurrent development of vessels, i.e. neo-angiogenesis, which provide oxygen and various nutriments. Preventing responses of the immune system throughout all the steps associated with the development of tumor metastases.    Dr. Dr\u00e9au\u2019s research centers on the mechanisms of cancer metastasis, and the vascular and immune interactions associated with cancer growth. More specifically, the following aspects of cancer metastasis are studied:  Key features of Metastatic Tumors Anchoring and Growth of Metastatic Tumors Vascularization of the Metastatic Tumors Interactions Immune System and Metastases; the role of inflammasommes in local inflammation  Research Opportunities:  Interested Graduate Students (either Ph.D. or M.S. students) should contact Dr. Didier Dr\u00e9au at: ddreau@uncc.edu For REU opportunities please check the REU Summer Program: Biology and Biotechnology at http://biology.uncc.edu/research/reu-biotechnology Interested Undergraduate Students (either Honors or BIOL3900 students) should contact Dr. Didier Dr\u00e9au at: ddreau@uncc.edu  Lab Members  Katherine Holtzman (PhD Candidate) Khanh Nguyen (PhD Candidate) Courtney Samuels (MS Student) Layla Abu Al Halaweh (Honors Student) Madison Snyder (Levine Scholar)  Lab Alumni  Postdoctoral Fellows  \u2013 Muthulekha Swamydas, PhD (2008-2010) \u2013 Danielle Van, PhD (2011-2012)  Graduate students  \u2013 Deepika Suryaprakash (MS Student, 2018).

Contact me if you would like to be on-board and make a contribution to understanding and tackling malaria!   Global epidemiology of malaria  While countries such as China and Thailand in Southeast Asia are approaching malaria elimination, Africa is still home to 90% of malaria cases and 92% of malaria deaths. In 2016, an estimated $2.7 billion was funded for malaria control and elimination. Plasmodium falciparum is the most prominent malaria parasite in Africa and is responsible for most malaria-related deaths globally. Other parasite species including P. vivax, P. ovale, andP. malariae are also observed in Africa, SE Asia, and South America. The fifth malaria parasite speciesP. knowlesi is only known to occur in SE Asia. Recently, P. simium has been confirmed in Brazil that switches from a monkey reservoir to human beings causing malaria.

As such, NK-1R antagonists have been subjected to extensive research for use in the treatment of a variety of disease conditions, and several of these agents have recently been introduced clinically to prevent nausea and vomiting. Importantly, our laboratory has assembled a compelling body of evidence indicating that substance P/NK-1R interactions exacerbate inflammation at mucosal sites and within the CNS. In addition to its effects on leukocytes, we have demonstrated that substance P exacerbates the inflammatory responses of resident brain cells including microglia and astrocytes to clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. Furthermore, we have also shown that endogenous substance P/NK-1R interactions are required for maximal inflammation and CNS damage in murine models of meningitis. Interestingly, our data indicate that prophylactic or therapeutic systemic administration of an NK-1R antagonist can markedly attenuate bacterially-induced neuroinflammation in animal models. As such, these data suggest that the NK-1R may represent an important new target in the treatment of potentially lethal CNS inflammation.

Glia utilize cell surface and cytosolic innate immune receptors to recognize microbial and viral pathogens  Glial cells such as microglia and astrocytes are increasingly recognized to play a critical role in the initiation, progression, and/or maintenance of inflammatory host responses to CNS pathogens. Our laboratory has been at the forefront in the study of the mechanisms by which these cells perceive viral and bacterial pathogens. The innate immune system recognizes a wide spectrum of pathogens without the need for prior exposure and the identification of highly conserved families of proteins that serve as microbial pattern recognition receptors including the Toll-like (TLR), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like (NLR), and retinoic acid inducible gene-I-like (RLR) receptors has shed light on the mechanisms by which this is accomplished. These microbial sensors precipitate the production of inflammatory cytokines and antiviral type I interferons. Hence, activation of cells in this manner can initiate the repertoire of defense mechanisms used by the innate immune system. We have shown that microglia and astrocytes express cell surface TLRs and use cytosolic sensors for the detection of intracellular pathogens that include NOD2, an intracellular receptor for bacterial peptidoglycans, and two members of the RLR family, RIG-I and MDA5, that serve as cytosolic sensors for replicative RNA viruses. Furthermore, we have subsequently described the expression of two cytosolic sensors for double-stranded DNA by glia, DNA-dependent activator of interferon-regulatory factors (DAI) and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), suggesting that these novel sensors might play a critical role in the detection of replicative DNA viruses by CNS cells.

Vibrio vulnificus  First described in 1976, Vibrio vulnificus is a halophilic bacterial species that causes primary septicemia and wound infections (Fig. 1). Disease in humans results from contamination of a skin lesion or ingestion of contaminated seafood. A striking feature is that many victims die with a few hours of symptom development) and the high mortality rate (>50% and 25%, respectively). The infectious dose of V. vulnificus is believed to be low and fatal infections have been reported after the ingestion of a single oyster (the primary source in 93% of all cases). Fatal wound infections acquired by contamination of ant bite lesions have also been reported. Between 1989 and 2008, 520 ingestion cases with 263 deaths (51%) were reported. Most cases (>85%) occur in males over the age of 40 (Fig. 2), as estrogen appears to block the endotoxin produced by this species.This is an opportunistic pathogen, with infections largely restricted (>95% of cases) to those having underlying liver diseases (such as liver cirrhosis or hepatitis). Three biotypes of V. vulnificus exist, and among biotype 1, the primary type in human infections, several very distinct genotypes are known to occur. One area of our study involves these genotypes. The C-genotype\u201d correlates strongly with a clinical origin, and these strains appear to be highly virulent. In contrast, the E-genotype\u201d correlates with isolation from the environment, and appears to be of lower virulence. At the DNA level, the two genotypes differ significantly from each other (some genes differ in >30% of their sequence), yet the two genotypes are highly similar within the genotype (Fig. 3). One enigma we are investigating is a result of our observation that, while the distribution of the two genotypes in estuarine waters appears to be approximately equal (Fig. 4), the oysters that inhabit those waters carry a high proportion (ca 85:15) of the E-genotype.

Path. Dis. Doi:10.1093/femspd/ftv072  Bacterial Stress Responses Many of the so-called heat shock proteins, such as chaperone proteins (e.g. DnaK and GroEL) and proteases (e.g. Clp, Lon), are also induced by other environmental changes, such as high osmolarity, nutrient starvation, exposure to low temperature, the presence of heavy metals, oxidative agents or pollutants, and interaction with eukaryotic hosts.Therefore, the heat shock response can more accurately be considered a general stress response.Through a process termed cross protection, this response improves tolerance to otherwise lethal temperatures, high or low salt levels, heavy metals, UV exposure, and starvation, and plays a critical role in bacterial pathogenesis.Such stress responses are critical forbacterial adaptation to the constant changes in the environment experienced by estuarine bacteria, such as most Vibrio spp., and are therefore a major link between microbial ecology, physiology, and microbial pathogenesis.One example is the htrA system, the product of which is essential for bacterial growth only at elevated (e.g. human body) temperatures. This system is activated by the alternate sigma factor, sE, encoded by the rpoE gene.This gene has been shown to control mucoidy in cystic fibrosis isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.In E. coli, transcriptional activation of the heat shock genes is induced by the alternate sigma factor, s32 (product of the rpoH gene). Our lab is interested in the bacterial response to a variety of environmental stresses, especially starvation, low temperature, high salinity (osmotic stress), and oxidative (e.g. peroxide) stress.The bacterium under greatest investigation I this lab is V. vulnificus. We study the mechanisms by which this pathogen survives in the estuarine environment, the molecular regulatory mechanisms which occur during these survival responses. Of special interest in this regard is the use of membrane diffusion chambers to examine in situ gene expression by cells in their natural aquatic environment.

Microbiol. 78:3885-3889.  The Viable but Nonculturable State Microbial ecologists have long recognized that large proportions of the microbial populations inhabiting natural habitats appear to be nonculturable.Indeed, plate counts of bacteria in soil, rivers and oceans typically indicate that far less than 1% of the total bacteria observed by direct microscopic examination can be grown on culture media. Further, it has also long been known that certain portions of bacterial populations in natural environments seem to disappear during certain seasons, only to reappear at other times. We now understand that at least part of the explanation for these observations is not due to seasonal die-off of the cells, but to their entry into a physiological state most commonly called the viable but nonculturable\u201d state. A bacterial cell in the viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state may be defined as one which fails to grow on the routine bacteriological media on which it would normally grow and develop into a colony, but which is in fact alive and metabolically active.Bacteria enter into this dormant state in response to one or more environmental stresses which might otherwise be lethal to the cell.Thus, the VBNC state should be considered a means of cell survival.Eventually, when the inducing stress is removed, these cells are able to emerge from the VBNC state and again become culturable on routine media. The typical VBNC response is seen in this figure, which shows the response of Vibrio vulnificus to exposure to low temperature (5oC). Such a temperature is below that at which this aquatic bacterium can grow and, if it were not for the VBNC response, is a temperature which would eventually lead to death of the population. VBNC cells lose their ability to be cultured in a rather linear manner, eventually reaching a point where plate counts suggest a total lack of any living cells.However, whereas death of a bacterial population generally leads to lysis of the cells and loss of cell structure, direct examination of cells entering the VBNC state indicates that the cells remain intact. Such cells could, of course, have died, but simply not undergone lysis.The primary evidence that such cells are alive, even if nonculturable, is from data obtained when a direct viability\u201d assay is applied to such cultures, or continued production of mRNA is detected.Such assays allow direct determination of individual cell viability, without the need for culture. Such assays generally indicate that a large portion of the apparently dead population is, in fact, alive. Cells entering the VBNC state generally undergo a reduction in size, and during this time, significant changes in membrane structure, protein composition, ribosomal content, and possibly even DNA arrangement are experienced.However, decreases macromolecular synthesis do not mean that all synthesis has ceased. Indeed, protein synthesis appears to be essential for entry into this state, and under these conditions V. vulnificus produces some 40 new proteins not seen during growth at normal\u201d temperatures.At the same time, dramatic decreases in membrane fatty acid composition, and in nutrient transport and respiration rates, have generally been reported to occur as cells enter this dormant state. Cell wall synthesis, or at least metabolism of the constituents of these structures, also apparently continues. Some of our most recent studies indicate that quorum sensing plays a significant role in resuscitation of cells from the VBNC state, signaling to dormant cells that conditions are good, and growth is now permissive.

Hepatic blood flow, particularly sinusoidal flow perfusion is essential for normal functions and metabolism of hepatocytes and also plays a crucial role in repair of injured cells in liver diseases. Regulation of sinusoidal blood perfusion consists of a delicate balance between the vasoconstrictor force and the vasodilator force that involve close interactions among the sinusoidal cells (i.e., endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells) and hepatocytes. The primary interest of this laboratory is to delineate the relationship between the sinusoidal cells and hepatocytes with respect to their interaction contributing to the regulation of constrictor and dilator forces in various stress conditions such as endotoxemic shock, hemorrhagic shock, liver cirrhosis and liver transplant. We recently discovered, for example, that endothelin, a locally released vasoconstrictor by endothelial cells and perhaps more importantly by hepatocytes under certain diseases, induces sinusoidal constriction by contracting hepatic stellate cells thus reducing sinusoidal perfusion, and this effect is opposed by vasodilators nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. Our primary goal is to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the balance of local constrictor and dilator forces in a variety of disease conditions and ultimately find drug interventions that help maintain liver perfusion under the stress conditions and rectify the injured tissue. Ongoing Projects:  Alterations in the regulatory mechanisms of hepatic microcirculatory perfusion in cirrhosis. Mechanisms of predisposition of the cirrhotic liver to hemorrhage/resuscitation and endotoxic shock. Mechanisms of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia induced liver injury in Apo-CI transgenic mice. Effect of caloric restriction on steatohepatitis in hyperlipidemic environment.

The DNA repair pathway is exceptionally important to prevent DNA breaks during normal replication and to remove DNA lesions after damage has occurred. Defects in combinations of DNA repair genes represent a double-edged sword that either enhances cell sensitivity or generates resistance to DNA damage agents, as in some cancers. Influence of FAM35A on end resection: During DNA replication, exposure to chemotherapy drugs such as camptothecin or PARP inhibitors can block replication forks, sometimes producing a one-ended double-strand break (DSB). FAM35A, in concert with REV7, RIF1, 53BP1, and other proteins, is proposed to be involved in suppressing the resection at a DSB that produces 3\u2019 single-stranded DNA. BRCA1-negative cells are unable to counter the inhibition mediated by this protein complex, resulting in cell death. In FAM35A-defective cells, 5\u2019 end resection can occur even in BRCA1 mutants, activating homologous recombination. This may be one mechanism of acquiring resistance to PARP inhibitor in BRCA1-mutant cells. However, excessive end resection can block the action of NHEJ. As an OB-fold protein, FAM35A may interact with single-stranded DNA and then block nucleases or interactions with other proteins. Our laboratory is working to define mechanisms of chemoresistance in prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers using approaches in biochemistry, protein complex (my favorite experiment), cell and molecular biology supplemented by newly available genome sequencing data (e.g. TCGA and ONCOMINE).

Capillary electrophoretic separations of protein charge ladders\u201d (otherwise pure proteins with intrinsic or induced charge heterogeneity) allow us to estimate the net charge and hydrodynamic radius of proteins in solution. We also study ligand binding to proteins using affinity capillary electrophoresis\u201d (ACE), which exploits the accompanying change in protein electrophoretic mobility. Combining charge ladders and ACE allows us to characterize overall conformational changes caused by ligand binding. And with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection, we can study the conformational behavior of fluorescently labeled proteins under simulated intracellular conditions\u2014especially in the presence of high concentrations of other macromolecules. We also have an active collaboration with a group in the Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics. We are using a variant of ACE called CEMSA\u201d (capillary electrophoretic mobility shift assay) to detect binding of transcription factors (TFs) to synthetic, fluorescently labeled DNA probes. We use this technique to experimentally validate predicted TF binding site sequences. After screening by CEMSA, we can identify affinity-purified TFs using mass spectrometry.

The technique of single-crystal X-ray crystallography is used to determine the detailed molecular structure of chemical compounds. Because this is a completely general method, it can be applied to almost any compound of chemical interest, and is thus an important tool in many different areas of research. The determination of a substance\u2019s structure by X-ray methods involves several steps, including 1) preparation of suitable crystals for study, 2) preliminary X-ray investigation for the determination of crystal quality and lattice type, 3) collection of high accuracy intensity data on an automated X-ray diffractometer, and 4) reduction and analysis of the data utilizing high-speed computers.

My friends sometimes jokingly refer to my research as \u2018blob\u2013ology\u2019. To the untrained eye, the results of modeling our data actually do look like \u2018blobs\u2019. If we have been attentive to the preparation of our samples as well as to the data collection/analysis process, however, what these models represent, are the low-resolution shape of a folded, functional protein.   High-resolution structures of the same protein in similar buffer conditions (such as that from the x-ray crystal structure shown on the right here)should fit well within our small-angle scattering based models. (As seen in the figure to the left). Why is shape important? A protein is a polymeric molecule, a long chain of individual units linked covalently together. In the case of a protein polymer, it is of a specific length and unit sequence. Every living system creates ~3000 different proteins, which function to do the chemical work required to sustain life. For proteins to function, those chains must fold up into a unique, often globular, form. It is the shape of a protein that dictates its function. Sometimes protein function is regulated(turned on or off) by other molecules through shape changes. The protein you see above is regulated by calcium ions, and its shape changes dramatically when calcium binds to it. We characterized this shape change by small-angle scattering and published our results in the Journal of Biological Chemistry 2007.  Our research will provide structural insights into the shape changes that are involved in activating or de-activating a protein. This regulatory process is referred to by biologists as \u2018signal transduction\u2019. There are a myriad of signal transduction mechanisms that work to keep living systems alive. Our scientific approach can provide a structural understanding of how a living system receives and responds to environmental information to elicit an appropriate response.

We pursue fundamental studies of molecular and nanoscale systems to understand directed and self-assembly processes. We aim to design new particles and materials with higher functionality and effectiveness. Our long-term interests are toward: novel mechanisms for mechanical transducers and sensors in NEMS, energy storage in supercapacitors, catalytic solar fuel production, water purification, and optical metamaterials.  We start by synthesizing novel coordination complexes that have useful and tunable spectral, electrochemical, and mechanical properties. We synthesize and purify single walled carbon nanotubes. We use various metal nanoparticles, quantum dots, and nanostructured carbons linked together by our coordination complexes to form higher order hybrid-nanomaterials. Some of these novel particles can be assembled into supraparticle assemblies with novel properties and function. Students in the Poler Research Group use many of the facilities and techniques in the Center for Optics and Optoelectronics, the Regional Analytical Chemistry Lab and the Department of Chemistry. Students are trained in clean room techniques (deposition, etching, growth, characterization). Students use various microscopy techniques including SEM, TEM, AFM, and STM. We use various spectroscopic methods such as: UV-Vis-NIR, Raman, IR, NMR, ESI-MS, circular dichroism, and fluoresce spectroscopy (steady state and time resolved). Materials and dispersions are also characterized by various thermal and mechanical methods including DMA, DSC, TGA, and isothermal titration calorimetry. Students use Static and Dynamic Particle sizing and zeta potential measurements on nanoparticle dispersions. We also support our experimental observations with computational modeling using the Materials Studio suite. We use high level DFT calculations on large cluster systems by running on multiple parallel processors maintained by the High Performance Computing center at UNC Charlotte.

A. (1982) Saint Joseph\u2019s University Dr. Arrigo began his professional career as a community organizer for and social activist on behalf of: (1) the homeless and marginally housed; (2) users of (mental) health services; (3) adult and juvenile ex-offenders; (4) survivors of sexual assault; and (5) abusers of licit/illicit drugs. Professor Arrigo\u2019s work with these vulnerable and/or victimized constituencies culminated when he directed and implemented the social designing housing strategy for the city of Pittsburgh\u2019s largest single room occupancy (SRO) facility, Wood St. Commons. His civic engagement in this area also included developing and managing the facility\u2019s human welfare and social policy agenda. During his Directorship (1987-1990), this agenda addressed the unmet needs of under-served and non-served children, adults, and families. Professor Arrigo was awarded the Ph.D. from the Department of Sociology and Criminology at the Pennsylvania State University in the Administration of Justice where he specialized in the study of law, mental health, and policy. He has additional graduate training in Law (Temple University), as well as advanced degrees in Psychology (Duquesne University) and in Sociology (Duquesne University). He served as founding Director of the Institute of Psychology, Law, and Public Policy at the California School of Professional Psychology-Fresno (1996-2001), and as Chair of the Department of Criminal Justice at the University of North Carolina \u2013 Charlotte (2001-2004). Dr. Arrigo\u2019s research and scholarship is interdisciplinary in its scope, and it is pertinent to the advancement of human justice and social change across a wide range of public interest controversies. More specifically, he relies upon normative, doctrinal, and/or qualitative methods of inquiry to investigate enduring problems or emerging issues in: (1) law, health, and policy; (2) theory, culture, and society; and (3) disorder, crime, and punishment. His exploration of these problems and issues extends from the interpersonal to the global and from the transnational to the transpersonal, resulting in more than 200 peer-reviewed journal articles, law reviews, chapters in books, and academic essays. He is also the (co)author or (co)editor of more than 30 titles and volumes, published or in press. Recent books include Revolution in penology: Rethinking the society of captives (Rowman & Littlefield, 2009), and The ethics of total confinement: A critique of madness, citizenship, and social justice (Oxford University Press, 2011). Recent textbooks and/or reference works include Introduction to forensic psychology 3rd ed. (Elsevier, 2012), The Routledge handbook of international crime and justice studies (Routledge, 2014), and The encyclopedia of criminal justice ethics, vol., 1-2 (Sage, 2014). Dr. Arrigo was the Editor-in-Chief of the peer-reviewed sociological quarterly, Humanity & Society (1996-2000); is founding and current Editor-in-Chief of the peer-reviewed behavioral science publication, Journal of Forensic Psychology: (Research and) Practice (2000- Present); and serves on the Editorial or Advisory Boards of several (inter)national periodicals relevant to the disciplines of sociology/criminology, law/legal studies, psychiatry/psychology, and social/public policy. Professor Arrigo was the founding Book Series Editor for Criminal Justice and Psychology (Carolina Academic Press) and for Critical Perspectives in Criminology (University of Illinois Press). He is also the General Editor for the 3-volume set, The encyclopedia of surveillance, security, and privacy (Sage, forthcoming). Professor Arrigo is the recipient of numerous professional awards and/or recognitions, and these honors are indicative of his prominence as a cross-disciplinary and multidisciplinary educator. Examples include: (1) elected Fellow, American Psychological Association (Div. 41, Law and Psychology) and elected Fellow, Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences; (2) Lifetime Achievement Award, Society for the Study of Social Problems (Div. on Crime and Juvenile Delinquency) and Lifetime Achievement Award, American Society of Criminology (Div. on Critical Criminology); and (3) the Joseph B.

The majority of his research focuses on drug use, abuse, and policy, but much of his work also focuses on the interplay between issues of health and deviance. Much of Dr. Stogner\u2019s drug research has focused on emerging or novel psychoactive drugs. These drugs (often referred to as legal highs\u201d or synthetics\u201d by the popular media and law enforcement) present an array of significant challenges to health care providers, law enforcement, and policymakers. In his published research, Dr. Stogner has examined prevalence and predictors of use, the effects of recent regulation, and offered policy recommendations for drugs such as Salvia divinorum, MDPV and synthetic cathinones (bath salts\u201d), and synthetic cannabinoids (spice\u201d). He is a coauthor of Emerging Trends in Drug Use and Distribution which explores both modern and historic novel drug issues. His most recent work in this area has focused on use of these substances among veterans and within the LGBTQ community. Some of Dr. Stogner\u2019s other drug research explores peer influence on drug use, the accuracy of perceptions of peer substance use, and substance use\u2019s effect on friendship quality. He has also explored how genetic factors condition reactions to stressful life events and how gene-environment interactions alter the likelihood that substance use is utilized as a coping mechanism. Dr. Stogner has also explored how health and deviant behavior are intertwined. He has published a series of articles that examine the role that health strain\u201d may play in antisocial behavior and substance use.

He is the author of Resisting Dialogue: Modern Fiction and the Future of Dissent (University of Minnesota Press, 2019) and has published or forthcoming articles and book chapters on a variety of themes and topics (see below). He is currently at work on two book projects. The first is tentatively titled Denizens! On Foreigners, Invaders, and Other Outsiders. This book takes a wide-ranging view and considers\u2014against the grain of the idea of citizenship\u2014how issues such as colonization, migration, the environment, labor, and the future of the human shed light onto an alternative way of being in the world. The other book project is a collection of key terms in the style of Raymond Williams\u2019s landmark Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society. Tentatively titled Z to A: A Vocabulary for the Post-Political Era, it provides a full, critical picture of the most important social, cultural, and historical issues that define the current post-political moment through entries such as F for Focus,\u201d J for Job,\u201d I for Investor,\u201d and P for Pandemic.\u201d  Book  Juan Meneses, Resisting Dialogue: Modern Fiction and the Future of Dissent. University of Minnesota Press, 2019.  Resisting Dialogue: Modern Fiction and the Future of Dissent reassesses our assumptions about dialogue and, in so doing, about what a politically healthy society should look like. The book argues that, far from an unalloyed good, dialogue often serves as a subtle tool of domination, perpetuating the underlying inequalities it is intended to address. With an investigation at its center of illusory dialogue\u201d (a particular dialogic encounter designed to secure consensus and eliminate dissent), the book offers a series of close readings of novels from the English-speaking world written in the past hundred years to show ways of restoring the radical potential of dialogue. Expanding the boundaries of post-political theory, Resisting Dialogue reveals how these works offer ways to practice disagreement against this regulatory use of dialogue and expose the pitfalls of certain other dialogic interventions in relation to some of the most prominent questions of modern history: cosmopolitanism at the end of empire, the dangers of rewriting the historical record, the affective dimension of neoliberalism, the racial and nationalist underpinnings of the war on terror,\u201d and the visibility of environmental violence in the Anthropocene.

I am particularly passionate about severe weather, whichmotivates my primary research interest in the dynamics of severe storms. I participated in VORTEX2, a large multi-agency field project that set out to learn more about how tornadoes and tornadic thunderstorms work. The project also inspired my current research trajectory focusing on the impact of heterogeneous environments on storm evolution. I am also interested in better understanding how changes to environments influence internal processes and storm behavior, using both observations and idealized modeling. My proximity to the Appalachian Mountains further inspires me to investigate the interaction of thunderstorms and complex terrain.

While I am interested in both patterns of regional development and the processes that produce them, my approach to teaching and research emphasizes empiricism and policy relevance. To that end, my research has focused on interregional patterns of spatial income distribution; the impact of urban form on segregation, spatial mismatch, business location, and metropolitan growth; the relationship of unearned\u201d income (transfer payments, interest, dividends, rent) to local employment; the impact of professional sports teams and facilities on metro areas; and industry clusters in regions undergoing rapid structural change. I also conduct economic impact assessments and program evaluations. Many of these research activities also find their way into my classroom. I am a firm believer that students at all levels are best served when they can apply theory and concepts to real issues of development, planning and policy.

My immigrationbased research has focused on: 1) the dynamics of concentrated poverty and immigrant experience at the neighborhood scalein major Canadian cities and 2) explorations of the causes, processes and implications of Hispanic hyper-growth\u201d in Charlotte, NC and the broader US South. My Canadian work has been published in outlets such as Urban Studies, International Journal of Canadian Studies, and the Annals of the Association of American Geographers while my US-based work onLatino migration can be found in journals such as Southeastern Geographer, Geographical Review, Implementation Science and Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine as well as in edited volumes such as Suburban Immigrant Gateways: Immigration and Incorporation in New U.S. Metropolitan Destinations (Brookings, 2008), Taking Local Control: Immigration Policy Activism in U.S. Cities and States (Stanford, 2010 ) Immigrant Geographies of North American Cities (Oxford, 2011). With Owen J. Furuseth, I am co-editor of Latinos in the New South: Transformations of Place (Ashgate, 2006). My revitalization and gentrification work has focused on processes of socio-spatial polarization in Vancouver\u2019s Downtown Eastside (Tijdschrift voor Economische en Sociale Geografie) and the unusual trajectory of corporate-led gentrification in Charlotte\u2019s Fourth Ward and central city core. In collaboration with Dr. Bill Graves, this work has been published in Southeastern Geographer and Journal of Urban Affairs and forms the springboard upon which our co-edited book Charlotte NC: The Global Evolution of a New South City (Georgia, 2010) was based. In addition to teaching and research, I serve asDirector of the PhD in Geography program (http://geoearth.uncc.edu/phd-programs/geography) andDirector of the College and Liberal Arts and Sciences\u2019 Interdisciplinary Urban Studies Minor (http://geoearth.uncc.edu/Undergraduate/urban-studies-minor.html). Beyond my department, I have served as a Faculty Research Associate with UNC Charlotte\u2019s Urban Institute (http://ui.uncc.edu/) and since 2016 have served as Faculty Fellow for the Levine Scholars Program (https://levinescholars.uncc.edu/)where I have responsibility for civic engagement, undergraduate research and the development of new education abroad opportunities. Off campus, I have a long-standing partnership with the Levine Museum of the New South (http://www.museumofthenewsouth.org/) with whom I have worked on their Speaking of Change, Courage in the City and Latino New South and !NUEVOlution! projects. Additionally, I served as a Senior Researcher with the Vancouver, Canada based Metropolis British Columbia Centre of Excellence for Research on Immigration and Diversity. Finally, I am co-founder of two civically engaged research groups. Established in 2005, and led by Dr. Michael Dulin, the Mecklenburg Area Partnership for Primary Care Research (MAPPR) (http://www.mapprnc.org/) is a trans-disciplinary research network with a commitment tocommunity-based participatory research (CBPR). MAPPR\u2019s research yields interventions eliminating barriers to primary care access for under-served populations and seeks to improve overall community health and well-being. MAPPR\u2019s work has received support from agencies such as the the Charlotte Research Institute, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. In 2015, in partnership with Dr. Claire Schuch, I co-founded and now co-direct the Receptivity, Integration and Settlement in New Gateways (RISING) Research Group. RISING isa consortium of community-engaged scholars, practitioners and advocates working with immigrants, refugees, asylees and their families in Charlotte, NC and other non-traditional immigrant destinations. Together we conduct applied research that seeks to measurably enhance the lives of these vulnerable populations and the broader communities into which the settle (https://pages.charlotte.edu/rising/).

My research interests are focused on transportation, housing, and firm location. In particular I am interested in the effects of public and private investments on firm and household location behavior and how these micro-level behaviors shape intra-urban sorting patterns. Some of my recent research projects include explorations into the effects of neighborhood amenities on residential sorting; rail transit investments on neighborhood change and residential mobility among low-income individuals; and economic impacts associated with the suburbanization of poverty.

(2002) Earth & Planetary Sciences, University of New Mexico B.S. (1997) Earth & Planetary Sciences, University of New Mexico  Profile  I have an intense interest in finding new and creative ways to reach students in large lecture classrooms. The format of traditional introductory geology and earth science courses is often ineffective in conveying fundamental scientific ideas to a general audience. The use of new technology and unique lecture styles to engage students is an area of active and continuous research for me. When I am not focused on the classroom, I am in interested in the geomorphology of alpine landscapes and the paleolclimatic proxy information they may contain. The last 20,000 years has been a time of significant climatic change, including the end of the last ice age and recent global warming. Understanding the timing of past climatic changes and deciphering their primary forcing mechanisms is of particular interest. Climatically sensitive alpine environments in and around the Colorado Plateau in the southwestern U.S. have provided an excellent venue for obtaining high-resolution evidence of these paleoclimatic changes. This data is largely recovered from low energy, depositional glacial features like cirques, kettle bogs, and kettle lakes. Obtaining these continuous, high-resolution sedimentary records is often a challenging and grueling logistical task and one that I relish! It is becoming more evident every day that our water resources are becoming increasingly stressed. The supply of sufficient and healthy drinking water is becoming increasingly challenging for a growing populace. Understanding the interaction of ground water, surface water, and contaminants is another area of personal interest. Across the midlatitude regions of the world, over reliance on ground water and the pollution of surface water is coming to a head. I am interest in increasing out understanding of how these reservoirs are connected in various geologic settings and using that information to initiate new and innovative ways to obtain, conserve, and protect these resources.

Geography, University of Georgia M.A. (1993) Geography, University of North Carolina at Charlotte B.S. (1990) Earth Sciences, University of North Carolina at Charlotte  Profile Greetings! My interests within geography reflect to varying degrees my research and teaching pathways. I currently teach courses ranging from the general education LBST 2301 (Critical Thinking and Communication) to applied spatial demography (GEOG 4255/52255). Topically, I teach courses in the regional geographies of the US and Canada and of the South ( GEOG 2155 and GEOG 2160), global food issues (GEOG 3250) and human-environment interactions (ESCI 2101 Environmental Dilemma). My interest in teaching extends to the richly rewarding world\u201d of geographic education. I enjoy working with pre-service and in-service teachers to expand our collective knowledge of geography in K-12 curricula. I am an active member of the National Council for Geographic Education (NCGE) which provides an essential connection to improving pedagogy and disseminating research findings. Further, I have an emerging interest in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) at the pre-collegiate and collegiate levels. In addition to these areas of study, I examine aspects of demographic aging, migration processes among working age and elderly populations, and housing vulnerability among the elderly. My future research agenda will continue to include this interest in the spatial implications of aging populations. This is an increasingly important public policy issue as the large and influential baby boom\u201d cohort reaches the later phases of the life course. Regionally, I have a long-standing interest in the historical and contemporary geographies of Appalachia as well as the spatio-temporal dynamics of cultural landscape formation in the South. Within the Department, I serve as the Undergraduate Coordinator for Geography. In this role, I am happy to meet with students (prospective, current or graduated majors) to discuss any aspect of Geography. I am the co-advisor for two student clubs in Geography: the Zeta Omega chapter of Gamma Theta Upsilon (international geography honor society) and the Charlotte Geography Club.

(1977) Geology, Oberlin College  Profile I am a sedimentary geologist interested in clastic depositional environments, basin analysis, the influence of tectonics on sedimentation, and in addressing applied environmental problems such as sedimentation in lakes and streams caused by urbanization. Sedimentary sequences I have worked on include Quaternary deposits in New York, the Canadian Rockies and the San Juan Mountains of Colorado, the Devonian Old Red Sandstone of Ireland and Pennsylvania, the Paleocene Fort Union Formation of Montana, Mesozoic rocks of the Stikine terrane of northern British Columbia, forearc basin deposits of the Chile margin triple junction region of Patagonia, and Permian basin deposits of west Texas and southeastern New Mexico. My sedimentological work has resulted in more than twenty-five refereed publications and 145 conference presentations. In addition, I have an active research program in the history of geology where I concentrate on the geologic work of Roderick Murchison in Scotland, Russia and Scandinavia. That research has resulted in numerous publications including two well-received books prepared in collaboration with Michael Collie. Our second book was published by the British Geological Survey in 2004 and is entitled Murchison\u2019s Wanderings in Russia. It is an annotated edition of Murchison\u2019s autobiographical journal where he describes his experiences during two field seasons in Russia, 1840 and 1841. During those field campaigns, Murchison, together with his colleagues Edouard de Verneuil and Alexander von Keyserling, mapped all of Russia in Europe including the Ural Mountains. It was this work that led to the naming of the Permian System.

She earned her PhD in 2015 from the Interdisciplinary Program of Language, Literacy, and Culture at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), where she also taught for the Gender and Women\u2019s Studies Department courses on introduction to women\u2019s studies, feminist methodologies, critical masculinities, and gender and globalization. Dr. Ergun\u2019s area of expertise is at the junction of transnational feminisms, cultural globalization, and feminist translation studies. More specifically, her research focuses on the role of translation in connecting feminist activists, discourses, and movements across geopolitical borders, particularly between the US and Turkey. Before coming to UNC Charlotte, Dr. Ergun worked as a contract lecturer at the Women\u2019s and Gender Studies Department at Keene State College in New Hampshire, where she taught courses on women of color feminisms, feminist activisms, and the politics of sex and virginity. Dr. Ergun is currently co-editing with Dr. Olga Castro of Aston University, a collection of essays called Feminist Translation Studies: Transnational and Local Perspectives. The volume aims to reconfigure feminist translation as a substantial force and form of political activism locally and transnationally. That is, the volume seeks to expand our understanding of feminist action not only to include feminist translation as feminist activism against multiple forms of domination, but also to rethink feminist translation through feminist theories and practices developed in different geohistorical and disciplinary contexts. By so doing, the collection seeks to expand the geopolitical and historical scope of the field of feminist translation studies from different disciplinary perspectives so that it becomes more transnational, interdisciplinary, and overtly political. Feminist Translation Studies is to be published by Routledge in March 2017. Dr. Ergun is also working on her first manuscript drawing on her doctoral dissertation. In this work, Dr. Ergun explores the ways in which the debiologizing virginity theories and knowledges of Hanne Blank\u2019s Virgin: The Untouched History (2007), an American book on the history of western virginities, traveled from the U.S. to Turkey through her politically engaged translation (2008). Conceiving feminist translation as subjective, local, and transnational activism, Dr. Ergun\u2019s research examines two key aspects of cross-border traveling of feminist virginity discourses: 1) the creative processes of feminist translation and the performative role of the translator\u2019s agency in these processes, 2) the receptions of the translated text in Turkey by feminist readers and the implications of their reading practices for local and transnational feminist politics. Comparing the U.S. and Turkey, two unevenly positioned cultures with different configurations of virginity and different legacies of feminist politics, the manuscript illustrates how a western book on women\u2019s sexuality was crossculturally mobilized to unsettle Turkey\u2019s virginity codes and what kinds of transgressive effects it generated within Turkey\u2019s feminist communities and the political lessons this textual travel process revealed for building transnational feminist solidarities. Dr. Ergun received the 2013 National Women Studies Association\u2019s (NWSA) Graduate Student Award for this research, given to works that contribute to feminist scholarship that is comparative, global, intersectional and interdisciplinary.\u201d The dissertation was also selected as a finalist for the 2015 NWSA and the University of Illinois\u2019 First Book Prize.

Her work interrogates some of the social and political categories through which everyday life is navigated. It focuses on questions of identity and conflict, religion and the secular, nationalism, citizenship, sovereignty, and colonialism. Looking at the work of historical representations in contemporary conflict, she reconceptualizes such conflicts by considering the ways historical events are variously imagined, and how alternatives to history\u201d itself might act as a framework for understanding conflict. The space of Israel/Palestine has served as herprimary empirical case, and critical and postcolonial theory the primary conceptual framework for thinking through these issues. Israel/Palestine is particularly useful in challenging and renovating particular aspects ofcritical theory. Dalsheim\u2019s work aims at seeing things otherwise by making unexpected comparisons and contrasts\u2014the hallmark of anthropological analysis. Much anthropology has been concerned with giving voice to the subaltern, minorities, and oppressed peoples. Dalsheim expands on these comparative projects by taking on what Laura Nader called the challenge of studying up.\u201d Her work looks athegemonic groups, exploring the analytical usefulness of ideas such as hegemonic and subaltern. These issues are explored in numerous journal articles, book chapters, and in Dalsheim\u2019s first three books: Unsettling Gaza: Secular Liberalism, Radical Religion, and the Israeli Settlement Project (Oxford 2011), andProducing Spoilers: Peacemaking and Production of Enmity in a Secular Age (Oxford 2014), and Israel Has a Jewish Problem: Self-Determination as Self-Elimination (Oxford 2019). Dalsheim came to UNC-Charlotte following aRockefeller Fellowship at the Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame, anda Lady Davis Fellowship at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. She previously taught atThe Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, and Wake Forest University.At UNC-Charlotte, Dalsheim teaches foundational courses in the concentration in Peace, Conflict, and Identity in the Department of Global Studies. Her courses are also cross-listed with Anthropology. She regularly offers courses on Cultures and Conflicts, Israel/Palestine and the role of Narratives in Conflict. She also works to de-colonize the curriculum through a project called Reading is Research.

African Americans were among the founders of the first Universalist churches in the eighteenth century, created their own liberal congregations beginning in the nineteenth century, and have continually pushed Unitarians and Universalists to be more attuned to social injustices. While their numbers have been few, African Americans have been profoundly affected by and made significant contributions to American religious liberalism. In addition to my research, I was the founding president of the African American Intellectual History Society. I started this organization and its group blog Black Perspectives in order to provide a space for scholars in disparate fields to discuss the many aspects of teaching and researching black intellectual history.

Her book traces the origins of what some white Argentines mischaracterize as a black disappearance\u201d by delving into the intimate lives of black women and explaining how they contributed to the making of a white\u201d Argentina. Erika Denise Edwards has produced the first comprehensive study in English of the history of African descendants outside of Buenos Aires in the late colonial and early republican periods, with a focus on how these women sought whiteness to better their lives and those of their children. Edwards argues that attempts by black women to escape the stigma of blackness by recategorizing themselves and their descendants as white began as early as the late eighteenth century, challenging scholars who assert that the black population drastically declined at the end of the nineteenth century because of the whitening or modernization process. She further contends that in C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina, women of African descent (such as wives, mothers, daughters, and concubines) were instrumental in shaping their own racial reclassifications and destinies. Hiding in Plain Sight has won the 2021 Western Association of Women Historians Barbara Penny\u201d Kanner Book Award, the 2020 Association of Black Women Historians\u2019 Letitia Woods-Brown Memorial Book Prize and named one of the best books of 2020 by the African American Intellectual History Society.

It was critical to community organizing, public displays of freedom, and in some places a defense force. Georgia had two types of militia companies: independent and state sponsored.

Current Projects I am currently working on a book-length project that examines how biomedicine and doctors both empowered and disrupted the system of South African indenture (1860-1911). Biomedicine was used and imagined as a tool of empire and industry, and also subject to the competing visions and responsibilities of various colonial forces, doctors, and the emergent field of public health. I am particularly interested in the international dimensions of this phenomenon, from negotiations between various colonial powers\u2014Britain, India, and Natal\u2014to evolving biomedical understandings of diseases like hookworm within tropical medicine. In particular, I seek to determine the conditions, such as the rise of a public health administration, that emboldened whistle-blowers who nudged reform in a system overwhelmingly stacked in the favor of the rich and powerful.

He became an Assistant Professor in 2017, and he was promoted to Associate Professor in 2021. His book, Mestizo Modernity: Race, Technology, and the Body in Postrevolutionary Mexico(University of Florida Press, 2018) discusses the role of science and technology in racial construction in postrevolutionary Mexico. He is currently finishing a second book with a tentative title of Cyborgs and Ne[cr]oliberalism: Robo-Sacer Resistance in Mexican and Chicano/a/x Fantastic and Science Fiction, 1992-2018. This book interrogates the markets of death that appear in neoliberal-era literature and film from both Mexican and Chicano/a/x cultural producers. Technology emerges as a tool of domination that oppressed people can subvert in an attempt to demand equal rights. Dr. Dalton has taught numerous classes at the graduate and undergraduate levels. He has mentored several MA and Honors theses on the following topics: cultural memory in Latin American cinema; healthcare systems in Latin America; race and ethnicity in postrevolutionary Mexican cinema; religion and identity in Latin America.

We are trying to understand the molecular logic underlying biological function. By nature, the research is highly interdisciplinary. Students will learn spectroscopic techniques (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence), molecular modeling, and gain basic biochemistry skills. Projects Structure-function-dynamics of proteins DNA transposition is the mechanism that can be used to deliver genetic information to mammalian genome. It has been employed for gene therapy and for functional genomics studies. The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system is the most frequently used DNA transposon in functional genomics, and is the first and only DNA transposon that has been adapted for human gene therapy. The SB system consists of the transposase enzyme and of the transposon DNA. From the biophysics point of view, the SB transposition is the sequence of steps during which the transposase interacts with the transposon DNA. Accordingly, we study these steps to create a dynamic picture with atomic-level resolution of how molecular components of the SB transposon system work together. Protein-protein interactions Chemokines form a large family of proteins that guide the migration of leukocytes in our body. We need chemokines to fight the infection, but they can also play a negative role by promoting autoimmune and allergic inflammatory reactions, cancer, atherosclerosis, or other inflammatory disorders. Chemokines act individually or interact to form heterooligomers. These interactions alter the biological activity of individual chemokines. We are looking at different chemokines to describe their interactions at atomic level in order to design molecule that will block (or enhance) the interactions, because we believe that it may lead to the development of more targeted, anti-inflammatory pharmacological agents with minimal side effects. Translational diffusion of proteins Biological processes depend on diffusive transport of molecules within cell and tissue. The first step of a biochemical reaction is the translational diffusion of at least one species to recognize another species involved in the reaction. To date, the translational diffusion of biopolymers, primarily globular proteins, has been studied in dilute solutions \u2013 idealized conditions required in most biophysical studies. We aim to understand the diffusion of biopolymers in solution in a wide range of concentrations when crowding is created by like or dislike molecules. Plant defensins Plant defensins form a family of proteins with a broad spectrum of protective activities against fungi, bacteria, and insects. Furthermore, some plant defensins have revealed anticancer activity. In general, plant defensins are non-toxic to plant and mammalian cells, and interest in using them for biotechnological and medicinal purposes is growing. The goal of this project is to gain an insight into structure, dynamics, and the mechanism of action of defensins from Pinus sylvestris.

At UNC Charlotte his efforts will be focused on the development of novel optical wave-guide and fiber devices for passive and active mid-IR applications. Dr. Aggarwal recently retired as Head of the Optical Materials and Devices Branch at NRL after 25 years of government service. Previously he worked at several companies including Corning and Lasertron Inc. He was a senior scientist at Corning responsible for glass and fiber research and development and did some of the pioneering work in the beginning days of fiber-optics development in the 1970\u2019s. At Lasertron he worked as a Vice President responsible for development and engineering operations of semiconductor Lasers and corresponding Electronic Devices. Dr. Aggarwal received his Master\u2019s and Ph.D. degrees from Catholic University of America. Dr. Aggarwal together with his team at Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) pioneered the development, applications and commercialization of infrared (IR) transmitting optical materials; (i) low loss IR transmitting glass optical fibers and (ii) rugged transparent ceramic spinel windows. He directed the research programs to solve the various technical and engineering issues and successfully transitioned the enabling technologies, along with 17 patents, to the industrial sector. These materials are now commercially available and are improving the performance of existing applications as well as enabling new applications which were not previously possible. The combined market impact for these materials is estimated to be in the billions of dollars. The specific details are highlighted below: The first company to bring this IR fiber technology to market was CorActive who licensed the IR fiber technology developed by Dr. Aggarwal and his co-workers at NRL. Several companies, including BAE Systems, Raytheon and ITT are utilizing the IR fibers in their infrared countermeasure (IRCM) systems to protect aircraft from shoulder launched IR guided missiles, called MANPADS (man-portable air defense systems). The IR fiber solution is an optical engineering success story since it enables relocation of the laser in a remote location and use of multiple jam heads with one laser, resulting in huge cost savings, enhanced agility, low weight, small size, robustness and reliability. In addition to IRCM, there are many other applications for IR Fibers. Some examples include remote fiber based sensors using infrared spectroscopy for real-time in-situ environmental pollution monitoring and facility clean up, biomedical tissue analysis/diagnostics and laser surgery. The high brightness IR emission from their rare earth doped fibers, including mid-IR fiber lasers, will enable tailored IR sources for remote spectroscopy. These fibers also have the potential to revolutionize next generation compact fiber amplifiers and enhance telecom bandwidths. The highly non-linear chalcogenide fibers are enabling bright sources and lasers (Raman lasers, broadband supercontinuum sources, and parametric frequency shifters) in the infrared wavelengths using less than one meter length of fiber which can\u2019t be done with conventional silica fibers. These so called active fibers\u201d may replace existing bulky OPO and gas laser systems used for sensor systems. Dr. Aggarwal also helped develop additional IR fiber products which include hollow core photonic band gap (PBG) fibers, as well as photonic crystal fibers (PCF). Polycrystalline ceramic magnesium aluminate i. e. spinel (MgAl2O4) is a rugged, hard and strong material, just like sapphire. It optically transmits wavelengths all the way from UV to the mid IR (0.19 \u2013 5 \u00b5m). However, high optical quality spinel ceramic was not available prior to NRL inventions. Dr. Aggarwal at NRL pioneered the key technological developments to solve various issues relating to transparency and strength. The major application for spinel ceramic is in transparent armor. High energy laser windows, missile domes, optics for IR sensors. MER Corp. licensed the spinel technology, along with 6 patents, to manufacture spinel for commercial and military applications. Dr. Aggarwal and his co-worker Dr. Sanghera were recognized nationally. They were the recipients of the highly prestigious Federal Laboratories Consortium (FLC), National Award for Excellence in Technology Transfer in May 2008. They also received the Mid-Atlantic Regional Award for Excellence in Technology Transfer in October 2007. Dr. Aggarwal\u2019s numerous awards include a Sigma Xi Award in 1998; several NRL Alan Berman Publication Awards; a number of Thomas Edison patent awards and many NRL outstanding performance awards. Dr. Aggarwal, along with Dr. Sanghera, has been selected to receive the 2011 David Richardson Medal from the Optical Society of America (OSA). They are recognized for their pioneering work leading to the development, production and commercialization of Infrared Fiber and Transparent Ceramics resulting in numerous IR products.\u201d Dr. Aggarwal has transitioned four technologies to industry, published over 300 papers, edited 3 books and co-authored more than 70+ patents.

His research examines theU.S. Supreme Courtand Courts of Appeals, U.S. state courts of last resort, and theSupreme Court of Canada. Generally, he has focused on two central questions: the role that information plays in judicial decision making and the effects of diversity on the judicial process. Within these frameworks, he has explored a variety of topics, including party capability, attorney expertise and gender, judge gender and race, judicial efficiency, judicial selection, majority opinion assignment, and judicial dissensus. He has published more than two dozen publications in a variety of outlets, including Political Research Quarterly,Law & Society Review, Journal of Law & Courts, American Politics Research,Politics & Gender,Journal of Public Administration Research & Theory,Social Science Quarterly, Politics, Groups & Identities, and the Marquette Law Review. Dr. Szmer\u2019s UVA Press book, coauthored with Jennifer Barnes Bowie and the late Donald Songer, The View from the Bench and Chambers: Examining Judicial Process and Decision Making on the U.S. Courts of Appealsexamines the U.S. Courts of appeals using a mixed methods approach, combining more than sixty interviews with appellate judges and clerks with a variety of statistical analyses. Dr Szmer was a co-principal investigator on a National Science Foundation research grant, Collaborative Research: Judicial Diversity and Appellate Decision Making\u201d, examining the impact of the Obama appointees to the U.S. Courts of Appeals, focusing primarily on the influence of gender diversity. He is also currently working on a co-authored book manuscript, Courting Diversity: How Race & Gender Matter from Bar to Bench (under contract with Cambridge University Press). The study explores how institutional structures and rules condition the effects of race and gender diversity on the judicial process. In addition to his research, Dr. Szmer teaches a variety of courses at UNC Charlotte, including judicial process, judicial politics, constitutional law, gender and the law, quantitative methods (for undergraduates and Ph.D. students), and the introduction to American politics.

His research interests have focused on the historical Jesus, Christian Origins, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and various forms of Judaism in the late 2nd Temple period. Tabor writes regularly for his popularTaborBlog here.He also has a Youtube channel featuring much of his work, including lectures and interviews here. Many of Dr. Tabor\u2019s articles and papers are archived here and can be downloaded as PDFs at no charge. His complete CV is here. Tabor is the author of ten books and numerous scholarly articles. His first book was a study of the mysticism of the apostle Paul titledThings Unutterable(1986), based on his University of Chicago dissertation. The prestigiousJournal of Religionnamed it one of the ten best scholarly studies on Paul of the 1980s. Tabor then turned to an analysis of attitudes toward religious suicide and martyrdom in the ancient world, the results of which appeared asA Noble Death, published by HarperCollins in 1992 (co-authored with Arthur Droge). Although the book centered on the history of such ideas in the ancient world, the results of this research have had immediate application in the contemporary discussion of the ethics of volunteer death and assisted suicide. It received an extensive essay review inChristian Century. During the 1993 Branch Davidian crisis in Waco, Texas, Tabor applied his expertise in interpreting biblically oriented apocalyptic worldviews to understanding the situation. As a result of his involvement Tabor publishedWhy Waco?Cults and the Battle for Religious Freedom in America(University of California Press, 1995), which he co-authored with Eugene Gallagher.Harper\u2019smagazine published a lengthy excerpt from the book (July, 1995). In 1995 Tabor testified before Congress as an expert witness on Waco. Tabor\u2019s 2006 book,The Jesus Dynasty:A New Historical Investigation of Jesus, His Royal Family, and the Birth of Christianity(Simon & Schuster, 2006), was aNew York Times Bestseller. Tabor presents the results of his work on the historical Jesus over the course of his career to a general audience. It has been translated into 25 languages and has become an international bestseller in the UK, Italy, Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands. In 2012 Tabor published two books: the first, co-authored with Simcha Jacobovici, The Jesus Discovery: The New Archaeological Find that Reveals the Birth of Christianity (Simon & Schuster) that offers a comprehensive overview of both of the Talpiot (Jesus family\u201d) tombs in Jerusalem with all the evidence brought together; and Paul and Jesus: How the Apostle Transformed Christianity (Simon & Schuster). Tabor has just published two new books, first,The Book of Genesis: A New Translation from the Transparent English Bible (Charlotte, NC: Genesis 2000, 2020), andPaul\u2019s Ascent to Paradise: The Apostolic Message and Mission of Paul in the Light of His Mystical Experiences (Charlotte, NC: Genesis 2000, 2020), both available in print and e-book via Amazon. He has just completed,The Lost Mary: From Jewish Mother of Jesus to Virgin Mother of God (forthcoming Knopf, 2023), but a French version is already available:Marie: De sonenhancejuice \u00e0 la foundation du christianisme(Paris: Flammarion, 2020). Over the past two decades Tabor has combined his work on ancient texts with field work in archaeology. He has worked at a number of sites in Israel and Jordan including Qumran, site of the Dead Sea Scrolls (1991, 1996), Wadi el-Yabis in Jordan (1992, 1996), Masada (1994), and Sepphoris (1996, 1999, 2000). In 2000 he teamed up with Dr. Shimon Gibson to excavate a newly discovered cave at Suba, west of Jerusalem that dates back to the Iron Age but was used for ritual rites in the early Roman period (2000-2006). Tabor and Gibson were also the principals involved in the discovery a 1st century Jewish burial shroud in a looted tomb at Akeldama. Their latest project is an ongoing excavation in Jerusalem onMt. Zionjust outside Mt Zion Gate along the Turkish city wall (2006-2018). Tabor is a popular public lecturer and writer and is often consulted by the national and international media (Time, Newsweek, USNews&World Report (cover story), NYTimes, LATimes, WashPost, Wall St. Journal, Harpers, Vanity Fair, AP, NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, Der Spiegel,Profil, The London Times). He is a regular blogger at the Huffington Post and does lectures, blog posts, and articles for the Biblical Archaeology Society.His work has been featured in dozens of TV documentaries (PBS Frontline, Discovery Channel,Nightline, 20/20, Learning Channel, History Channel, National Geographic,Smithsonian, BBC, Channel 4 UK, ZDF).

My M.A. degree is in Religious Studies with a focus on Chinese religion. My liberal studies courses focus on displaced religious groups (religious diasporas), especially Asian groups but also Jewish and African-American. Also, I\u2019ve taught Introduction to Asian Religions for the past several semesters, focusing on visual imagery, mythologies, and cultural worldviews.In my free time, I visit with family, watch endless episodes of Big Bang Theory on DVD, read fiction and humor (often while watching Big Bang Theory), and socialize with far-flung friends on Facebook. Research Interests I am interested in understanding South and East Asian religions as lived religions, particularly through the lens of historic and current globalization. My studies focus on the processes of cultural movements, acclimation, and adaptation and the intersections between popular and orthodox understandings of religion. Related interests include the psychological processes of learning and how best to incorporate techniques like narratives and realia into the globalized microcosm of a college classroom.

My name is Justin Cary and I am a Lecturer in the Writing, Rhetoric, and Digital Studies Department at UNC Charlotte. I have been teaching for almost ten years now and I have been at UNC Charlotte since 2011.I really love the work I do; both as a teacher and as a member of an exciting new Department. I believe in the real world potential for writing and what it can do; that helping students better understand tools at their disposal (such as rhetoric, visual literacies, inquiry and critical self-reflection) will ultimately help them apply those tools for success during college and beyond.  Writing works; it can do things. Writing is real and it has real world applications in every profession. From a teaching standpoint, I use a wide variety of techniques to help students practice and apply writing. From integrating social media platforms into writing projects to opening up the course and allowing students to inquire into topics they feel passionate about, my teaching practice is always developing and always evolving. Most recently, my work has revolved around Digital Rhetoric; the study of evolving rhetorical strategies and technique and the role those strategies and techniques play in cutting edge writing situations. For example, I have been studying the potential for hybridizing digital texts into part digital part analogue compositions using digital composition and 3D printing. I also love video games! I have been playing them since I was a little kid and from time to time I bring these works of art and composition into the class so we can see how writing, rhetoric and composition function in these digital spaces.  In many of my courses we use Podcasting as our primary composing medium; here\u2019s why.  Currently, I am teaching UWRT 1104; the hybrid, First-Year Writing course taught by WRDS faculty. I am also teaching LBST 2301; a Critical Thinking and Communications course that focuses on the rhetoric of online gaming communities and how folks use writing to convey complex messages across platforms such as Twitch.

Lee, Ph.D. Webpage   Bioheat and Mass Transfer Laboratory: Research: Currently we are working in a number of research areas related to Biomedical Engineering   Hypothermic machine perfusion preservation of livers for transplantation:  With over 15,000 patients waiting for liver transplantation and over 1100 deaths a year as a result of organ shortages, there is a need to improve preservation of livers and new ways to expand the donor pool. Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) has the potential to provide better quality livers for transplant and reclaim marginal organs that currently are unusable. Currently, HMP has not improved long-term storage (>24 hrs) of livers and our group is investigating the cause of damage. Three subprojects related to this work are: A. Determining the effect of shear stress at hypothermic temperatures on endothelial cells in the isolated livers. Our group is able to machine perfused a liver on a temperature controlled microscope stage and image the sinusoidal structure of the liver with intravital microscopy. B. Understand the effect of shear stress on endothelial cells in a microshear chamber at hypothermic temperatures. Using primary cultures of liver endothelial cells we are using video microscopy to assess endothelial cell shape as a function of shear stress. C. Investigate the potential of reclaiming non-heart-beating donor livers with machine perfusion. Donors that experience cardiac arrest prior to removal of their organs experience periods of warm ischemia which make the organs unusable. Our group has shown that machine perfusion has the potential to reclaim and preserve for short periods these organs for transplant. D. Investigate the potential in preserving fatty livers by HMP. E. Collaboration with Carolinas Medical Center Transplantation Group and Organ Recovery Systems to scale-up HMP livers for transplants.  Bioinstrumentation: Our group is finding that we need to build instruments for our research purposes and that these devices may have broader applications. We will continue to build such devices for diagnostics and imaging purposes.  Selected Publications:Pegg, D.E., Rubinsky, B., Diaper, M., Lee, C.Y.
