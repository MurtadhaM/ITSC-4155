We can improve teacher-student interactions by providing teachers with explicit evaluations, feedback, and training. However, teacher improvement efforts must be supported by reliable, valid measurement and rigorous research designs. In my research program, I seek to 1) measure teachers\u2019 practice of effective teacher-student interactions through observations that are reliable and valid, 2) measure teachers\u2019 knowledge of effective interactions related to observed teacher practice and to student outcomes, and 3) identify processes that improve teachers\u2019 practice and knowledge of effective teacher-student interactions in school contexts.

Welcome to my faculty webpage. Here you\u2019ll get to know me as a professor by perusing the site to find information on the research I\u2019ve done as well as information on current projects and classes I teach. In addition you\u2019ll find helpful links to relevant information and videos. INTERACTIVE LEARNING and SCIENCE EDUCATION: My passion is teaching science through interactive learning. I teach biology to both majors and non-majors and aim to integrate both creativity and practicality. I write songs and poems about class material to entice and enhance interest. I also integrate Practical Biology\u201d and Wildwood Wisdom\u201d sections to inform students of the application of concepts they are learning in class. I strive to make learning as interactive as possible by creating a multitude of in-class activities and facilitating continuing group work. I use as many tools as possible including eLearning suites such as Canvas and SymBio as well as in class transmission software such as Poll Everywhere to further improve interaction among students. Field Ecology \u2013 in the field and in the lab: I teach field ecology and coordinate the ecology labs. Field ecology\u2019s main goal is to provide students with an understanding of their local ecosystem using modern sampling methods. Wildlife biologists, zoologists, conservation biologists, ecologists, botanists, dendrologists, marine biologists, agronomists, entomologists, ornithologists, biological science technicians, park rangers,veterinarians and even curators of natural science museums often develop their first practical field skill set in field ecology and ecology lab. Due to this it is often an extremely exciting and challenging experience. I do my best to pique student interest and provide them with the skill set necessary to begin one of many career options in the world of natural sciences. Principles and General Biology: Principles of Biology is an integral part of many majors\u2019 undergraduate careers including nursing, psychology, and education majors. In addition, it is often the class where many students decide they want to study biology for the long term. As a non-majors biology class it is extremely challenging and creativity in teaching methods is a necessity to maintain interest in a course that covers all aspects biological life and how it functions. Click here for a sample song I sing to my classes about mitosis. I also teach the introductory course sequence (2120 and 2130) of biology for majors. As these courses are often grueling in detail I make each lecture thematic to best capture students attention. We don\u2019t study the respiratory system, we learn how Freedivers manipulate it. We don\u2019t study animal development, we learn why Heptapods are the perfect aliens. I also teach students a number of Mnemonic systems in these classes that they can use to maximize their memorization abilities throughout their collegiate career. PROJECTS Arbor 49er: Arbor 49er was created to optimize student interaction with their local ecosystem while simultaneously enhancing the skill set of ecology students. Many universities have representative tree species labeled throughout campus and are even nationally recognized arboretums. In an effort to put UNCC\u2019s trees on the map\u201d so to speak I created the initiative termed Arbor 49er. 49 representative tree species on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte were selected by myself and students in my Fall 2012 Ecology Lab. Pictures of the species were taken and exported to the appropriate cartographic locations in Google Earth. Demographic data were gathered on the trees and descriptions were written for each tree species. Thus, an interactive map was created. For more information on the evolution and collaboration of this project click the Arbor 49er tab above. Downloadable Google Earth files can be assessed via the Arbor 49er tab in either fully descriptive or mystery tree hunt form as well. A hard copy brochure is available and permanent brass signs are now in place! Piedmont Diving Rescue Association: As the Environmental Quality Research Officer for the North Carolina Piedmont Diving Association (PDRA), I monitor water quality and overall ecological health of a number of local quarries. These quarries are used for both recreational and rescue dive training. They are also a unique learning environment as they provide an opportunity for students to conduct studies outside of the campus ecological reserve.Together with the PDRA my students and I aim to maintain the health of these quarries semester after semester. RESEARCH Barred Owls: Who cooks for you! Who cooks for you too!\u201d goes the often phrased Barred Owl call. The first research I conducted was alongside Dr. Richard Bierregaard and involved studying the local Barred Owl (Strix varia) population in its suburban habitat. The focus of this study was South Charlotte. I built traps, radio tagged, and then telemetry tracked the owls at night. Pretty scary, huh? These locations were then registered in Google Earth for later use in demographic study. We built owl boxes to encourage nesting and installed nest cams to monitor prey delivery as well. You wouldn\u2019t believe what Barred Owls eat! For more information on this awesome study click the Barred Owl tab above. American Bullfrogs: To us, the American Bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) is quite harmless. However, believe it or not, among amphibians they\u2019re tough guys and dangerous predators. They\u2019ve been known to eat small birds and even each other! For my graduate studies, with Dr. Sue Peters, I investigated the role of testosterone on the musculature involved in grappling and amplexus (bullfrogs mating embrace). In a world with increasing pollution, natural waterways are easily susceptible to destruction. Amphibians are classic indicators of ecological health and relevant research conducted in relation to their evolutionary adaptations is invaluable for their conservation.

Reitzel Associate Professor of Biology PhD, Boston University, 2008 My laboratory is interested in answering integrative questions concerning the evolution and ecology of coastal invertebrates by using an interdisciplinary approach that combines comparative genomics, molecular biology, population genetics, evolutionary ecology, and field studies. We utilize species in the phylum Cnidaria (sea anemones, corals, and jellyfishes) as models because of their ecological importance and phylogenetic position. Our focal species is the starlet sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis, which has emerged as a model cnidarian species due to availability of a sequenced genome, ease of culture in the laboratory, and distribution in high marsh estuarine habitats.

Many cancer proteins are inherently unstable and need chaperones to maintain activity. We are interested in the basic questionof the role of molecular chaperones in breast and prostate cancer. We are focused in novel ways to manipulate Hsp70 function by either inhibiting specific helper\u201d co-chaperone proteins such as Hsp40 or by modulating phosphorylation on Hsp70. By fine-tuning\u201d Hsp70 function, we hope to identify novel ways to destabilize cancer proteins.

At the nanometer scale, noble metals such as gold, silver, platinum, and copper exhibit unique, synthetically tunable optical properties. One such property of noble metal nanomaterials is the large optical field enhancement leading to strong absorption and scattering of light. We use the synergy between the enhanced optical properties of noble metal nanomaterials and the intrinsic electronic, optical, and vibrational responses of molecules to develop new functional nanomaterials and analytical methodologies. Techniques combining our light-based analytical approaches with the new functional nanomaterials will allow us (i) to elucidate dynamic interactions between various interfaces of nanoscale materials and biological-chemical systems, (ii) to develop a mechanistic understanding of molecular-level processes significant in medicine and energy applications, and also (iii) to develop field-transferable diagnostics and translational nanotheranostics. The outcomes of our work impact a wide range of fields, including nanomedicine, medical diagnostics, food and agriculture and also energy industry.

By oxidizing or reducing these compounds we often generate species that undergo interesting reactions or form complexes in unusual oxidation states. In many cases redox activation of organometallic complexes accelerates known reactions of these compounds, activates otherwise inert complexes, or allows reactions to occur under milder conditions. We study the reactions and their products using electrochemical methods and other instrumental techniques including, but not limited to, NMR, IR, ESR and GC/MS.

(1977) Geological Sciences, Virginia Tech B.S. (1974) Geology, Birmingham-Southern College  Profile My long-term research interests include the tectonics and regional geology of the Southern Appalachian Mountains, particularly within the eastern crystalline core of the chain. Numerous embedded orogen-parallel ductile shear zones in this area contain kinematic indicators for strike- or oblique-slip during mid- to late-Paleozoic deformation that is more characteristically compressional in the western part of the mountain belt. In addition to the Paleozoic kinematic significance of these structures, many shear zones also were reactivated to nucleate Mesozoic rift basins. I have continued to evaluate all of these relationships in field sites throughout North Carolina and Virginia. Part of my research in continuous deformation is theoretical. It is clear in many ductile shear zones that deformation cannot be exclusively pure shear or simple shear. This recognition leads to the need to establish models for shear that incorporate vorticity components of pure and simple shearing. The result of this analysis is the kinematic vorticity number, a measure of the balance between shearing components that has been found to be verifiable with field studies. This line of research is intermittent, but continues to be of interest. I also am involved in studies of neo-tectonics. In the Appalachians, neo-tectonics\u201d often refers to the identification of structures that could be related to Tertiary and/or Quaternary activity. I have previously studied potential neo-tectonic areas along the Fall Line in eastern Virginia. Presently, I am planning an investigation of possible Quaternary faulting in the western Virginia Piedmont in the Mountain Run fault zone, which lies at the physiographic boundary between the Blue Ridge and Piedmont provinces. Recently I have been working with Missy Eppes and John Diemer to investigate an area of active deformation along the northern piedmont of the San Bernardino Mountains in California. There we have used ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to delineate sub-surface structures in an active faulted anticline. This work continues with additional near-surface geophysics and structural mapping to provide a model for the fault-fold relationship there. I teach applied geophysics and also use some of these tools in field research. In addition to the GPR work in California, with John Diemer and Missy Eppes and a class of graduate students we have done GPR profiles of pond sediment and colluvial debris in the western Piedmont of North Carolina. Also, with Craig Allan and John Diemer we have compiled a grid of GPR profiles in Ontario, Canada to assist in the study of the sub-surface component of a watershed study. I am currently involved in an on-going research project with John Diemer and Missy Eppes to study the source and distribution of home radon in the eastern Inner Piedmont of North Carolina. This project area, which is funded by the NC Radiation Protection Office, is located where radon concentrations are known to be above background values for the region. I maintain a program of outreach and innovation in geoscience education. For several years, I have taught an intense, hands-on summer institute for in-service K-12 schoolteachers. This field- and lab-based course is oriented on content and experience. I also am actively involved in developing online physical geology courses for non-science majors or teachers through UNC Charlotte and through the UNC general administration.

He previously served as national historian for the US Forest Service in Washington, DC, where he was involved with a wide variety of public history projects including historical films, websites, oral histories, interpretive planning, exhibit development, historic preservation, and heritage tourism initiatives. In addition, Shapiro worked on collections management and federal records issues and regularly provided historical policy papers for staff. As agency historian, he developed relationships with interagency and non-profit partners to further the goals of the agency history program. Before joining the Forest Service, Shapiro was Assistant Director of the Scholl Center for Family and Community History at Chicago \u2018s Newberry Library. At the Newberry he served as academic director for two Department of Education Teaching American History grants, working cooperatively with the Chicago Public Schools and Chicago-area cultural and non-profit institutions. Shapiro received his MA and PhD in History from the University of Chicago and a BA in History from the University of Pennsylvania. He is particularly interested in questions regarding the intersection of people and place, changing perspectives of the cultural and natural landscape, and connections between memory, heritage, and public historical interpretation. His research explores questions about the history of land use and environmental change, modern environmental politics, the relationship between work and leisure, and broader cultural transformations in twentieth century urban and rural America.

It compares the content of advice to parents printed in German, Dutch, English, and French and identifies women active within these networks of religious exchange to highlight instances in which ministers provided women with the tools to write and publish devotional texts by insisting that women engage in domestic religious practices including reading and writing devotional texts, offering religious instruction, and even leading home worship services.

A simple but powerful assumption provides the foundation for my research: people create what they experience through the goals and beliefs that drive their behavior. As a social psychologist, I draw from the close relationships literature and use a combination of methodological approaches to explain the very basic, but often overlooked issue of how people\u2019s intentions toward others affect their relationships and the consequences of these processes for the self and others. I examine these processes across various types of relationships, including in roommates, friends, coworkers, married and dating couples, and in interactions between strangers and acquaintances. My program of work shows that people\u2019s goals or intentions toward others have powerful consequences for close relationships and personal well-being. When people have compassionate goals to support others, they and their relationships flourish: they give to others and others reciprocate, leading to better relationships and enhanced personal well-being for both people. People with self-image goals to manipulate others\u2019 views of the self focus on meeting their own needs and view others as a means to get what they want or need. As a result, they and their relationships function poorly: they give less and others reciprocate, leading to poor relationship functioning and diminished personal well-being for both people (Canevello & Crocker, 2010; 2011; Crocker & Canevello, 2008; Crocker, Canevello, Breines, & Flynn, 2010; Mischkowski, Crocker, Niiya, Canevello, & Moeller, under review). More recently, I have begun to examine the ways in which interpersonal goals shape responses to adversity, including approaches interpersonal problems, forgiveness following relationship transgressions, and personal growth following traumatic events. Broadly, my research attempts to answer big questions, such as:  When and how do we create upward and downward spirals in our relationships with others? How do we contribute to what others experience? What does it mean to have good relationships and how can we create them? What are the benefits of giving vs. receiving?  If you are interested becoming a research assistant in Dr. Canevello\u2019s lab: You should submit application materials the semester before you would like to join the lab. Applications for the Fall semester are accepted the previous spring; applications for the Spring semester are accepted the previous fall. Minimum requirements for these positions include: at least sophomore standing, a minimum 3.2 GPA (3.5 or higher is strongly preferred), previous research experience is a plus, and I rarely take people who have not completed the first research methods course (however, applications for outstanding students who do not meet one of these requirements may be considered). RAs work for research credit. I prefer that they take 3 hours, which translates to 12 hours per week in the lab, but I sometimes consider taking students for 2 credits (i.e., 9 hours per week). Generally, my team works between 9am and 5pm Monday through Friday (we sometimes extend those hours a bit). We don\u2019t typically work evenings or weekends, though again, we sometimes have to make exceptions. Specific schedules will depend on the kinds of data that we collect \u2013 if we\u2019re doing something with couples in the lab, it takes 2 RAs; running more simple procedures will only take one RA. But once we set a schedule, that will be the schedule. You would work the same hours every week and our weekly lab meeting would always be at the same time.

I am still maintaining my UNCC research activities.    Education  Both my undergraduate and graduate degrees are from University College Dublin (UCD), Ireland.  Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering, July 1995    Doctorate (Ph.D.) in Mechanical Engineering, January 2002.   My Ph.D. was on the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of silicon oxide coated wafers. This project was funded by Intel, Ireland. The research involved looking at CMP process fundamentals such as temperature distributions, pressure distributions and pad wear. As part of my Ph.D. I was lucky enough to spend a year conducting experiments in both UC Berkeley, CA, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), MD.  Previous Ventures  After graduating with my engineering degree (1995) I worked for over a year with BOSE, Ireland (the loudspeaker people). There I supported production and was involved in new project introduction. After a year and a bit I went back to College to get my Ph.D. (see above). On completion of my Ph.D. I got an EU funded Marie Curie Fellowship position at Carl Zeiss in Oberckocken, Germany. Carl Zeiss make optical components for everything. I was there from March 2002 to March 2004. During that time I learned about traditional polishing, advanced finishing techniques, production considerations, metrology and most importantly how to speak German (sort of ish).  Present Day  I joined UNC Charlotte in August 2004 and am a tenured Professor within the Department of Mechanical Engineering.
