My current research investigates the innate immune response of neurons and the impact of microglia in recovery from WNV neurotropic infection. Cognitive dysfunction is a well-documented correlate of viral encephalitis; however the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear, in part due to lack of murine recovery models. To study the mechanisms of recovery from viral encephalitis, I use a murine model of intracranial infection with an attenuated strain of West Nile virus (WNV). My overarching hypothesis is that viral encephalitis incites inflammation that accelerates processes of CNS aging, contributing to the development of AD pathology and neurodegeneration.    Research in my laboratory uses the WNV encephalitis model to investigate I) how neuroinflammation alters genetic and synaptic programs, which affect and denote aging processes, II) how aging affects microglial response to inflammatory events, altering neuroinflammatory signatures, and III) how neuroinflammatory events affect pathological Tau accumulation, a well-studied correlate of neurodegeneration.

Multicellular eukaryotes (animals and plants) are familiar to everyone.However, these groups form only a few branches in the amazing evolutionary tree of eukaryotic diversity. The other eukaryotes are mostly microscopic, single-celled organisms commonly called algae, protists or microbial eukaryotes. They occur in all ecosystems and exert profound effects onthe planet and all life, ranging from economically and environmentally-destructive Harmful Algal Blooms to forming the base of the marine food web and providing the majority of oxygen to the biosphere.   Research in my laboratory focuses on the ecology, diversity and evolution of microbial eukaryotes. Specific topics include ecology of harmful algal blooms, biodiversity and evolution of protists, and use of algae and fungi in biotechnology such as biofuel production.

Tumor associated MUC1 plays a crucial role in progression of cancer by influencing cellular growth, transformation, adhesion, invasion, and immune surveillance. Tumor-associated MUC1 differs from the MUC1 expressed in normal cells with regard to its biochemical features, cellular distribution, and function. In cancer cells, MUC1 participates in intracellular signal transduction pathways and regulates the expression of its target genes at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Our Lab studies the functional differences that exist between normal and tumor-associated MUC1 using genomics and proteomics tools. Major focus is assessing tumor associated MUC1 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer.

From a broader perspective, the DDR machinery plays important roles in fundamental biomedical fields, such as DNA replication, DNA damage repair, cell cycle regulation, transcription, apoptosis, senescence, and autophagy. Defective DDR pathways compromise genomic integrity, leading to human diseases. The research projects in the Yan lab focus on several essential questions linking DDR and human diseases, such as cancer, sepsis, aging, and neurodegenerative disorders. Using biochemical, molecular and cellbiology approaches, our laboratory is interested in crucial issues in maintaining genomic stability, including checkpointactivation, DNA damage repair, and translesion synthesis (TLS) in response to DNA replication stress and oxidative stress as well as other stressful conditions. Ultimately, our research program will help to better understand how cells maintaingenome stability and to provide novel clues for detection and treatment of human diseases.Xenopus egg extracts and mammalian cell lines will be used as model systems to investigate fundamental biomedical questions with cutting-edge technologies.

A major emphasis in my lab is on the communication signals that regulate and adjust colony activities in response to changing conditions. Two communication signals are examined. First, we explore how the waggle dance is used to regulate colony-level foraging activity and movement. We use waggle dance activity to map spatial foraging patterns and determine how these patterns change with changing colony food needs. We also use the waggle dance to investigate movement patterns when colonies undergo reproductive swarming and seasonal migration. Second, we study the role of the vibration signal [in the video clip below, the bee with the tag Red 51 begins vibrating at 9 seconds].  https://pages.charlotte.edu/stan-schneider/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2012/02/R51-vibrator-audio-muted.wmv The vibration signal is one of the most commonly occurring communication signals in a colony and helps to regulate cooperative activities among workers. We have determined that the signal functions as a type of modulatory communication signal that causes a non-specific increase in activity. This, in turn, enhances many different behaviors, including foraging, brood care, food processing nest maintenance, swarming and house hunting. We have also found that workers use the vibration signal to influence queen behavior during colony reproduction, queen rearing and queen replacement. https://pages.charlotte.edu/stan-schneider/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2012/02/R51-vibrator-audio-muted.wmv [In the video clipabove, a worker vibrates a virgin queen at 1 s and then again at 12 s, immediately after which the queen performs piping]. The vibration signal may therefore play a major role in coordinating multiple colony activities.  A second emphasis in my lab is on the biology and behavior of the African honey bee, Apis mellifera scutellata. The African bee was introduced into South America in the 1950s and has become a major threat to beekeeping and agriculture in many parts of the Neotropics. Our work focuses on the nesting biology, foraging behavior, defensive behavior, swarming and migratory movements of the bee in both Africa and Latin America. We are determining the factors that have contributed to the rapid spread of the African bee in the new world. We also are examining if the behavior of the bee in Latin America differs from that in its native African environment. Most recently, we have begun to explore the survival and success of European-African hybrid colonies, because hybridization is at the heart of most programs designed to manage the African honey bee in the new world.

Collateral Antibiotic Sensitivity  Antimicrobial resistance is a problem facing our medical system due, in part, to evolution of resistant bacteria. In CF antibiotic resistance is more common than in the general public due to the continual administration of antibiotics given prophylactically or in response to an exacerbation. It has long been recognized that bacteria can display cross-resistance (when a bacterium develops resistance to one antibiotic it simultaneously becomes resistant to another antibiotic, even without exposure to that second antibiotic). Recent studies have demonstrated collateral sensitivity. In response to antibiotic treatment a bacterium becomes resistant, and then, in response to treatment with a different antibiotic, eventually develops resistance to that second antibiotic. Collateral sensitivity (CS) is when a bacterium that developes resistance to a treatment antibiotic (abx #1) also becomes sensitive to a different (i.e. non-treatment antibiotic [abx #2]). In reciprocal CS, if that bacterium resistant to abx #1 is then evolved to become resistant to abx #2, it simultaneously loses resistance to abx #1. This little studied phenomenon suggests the possibility of addressing antibiotic resistance by cycling between the two antibiotics in a reciprocal CS pair. The challenge is to identify the antibiotic combinations that lead to collateral sensitivity as well as the mechanism underlying the phenomenon. Burkholderia multivorans, a member of the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), is a Gram negative bacillus that is a pathogen often found in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) . We are exploring collateral sensitivity and cross-resistance networks in B. multivorans and B. cenocepacia. Our goals are to 1) develop a collection of strains evolved to be resistant by serially exposing clinical isolates of Burkholderia to one of eight clinically-relevant antibiotics, 2) test resultant strains against the other seven drugs to determine collateral resistance and susceptibility patterns, 3) subject evolved strains to whole genome sequencing to identify candidate mutations and genes involved in cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity, and 4) introduce candidate mutations into wild type strains to confirm which mutations/genes are involved in CS. To date, goals 1, 2 and 3 have been accomplished to varying degrees (see DOI:10.1089/mdr.2019.0202 and DOI:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105994). Funding from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation was recently obtained in collaboration with Dr. Way Sung (UNC Charlotte, Bioinformatics & Genomics Dep\u2019t) to expand these studies to include additional antibiotics and Burkholderia species.  Change in Microbiota in CF Patients in Response to Antibiotic Treatment. In Cystic Fibrosis (CF), a mutation in the CFTR gene results in the production of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs that is difficult to remove. Bacteria that are normally not pathogenic in the lungs grow in this mucus and cause a chronic infection and inflammatory immune response. In CF patients, there are several bacteria that are resistant to most known antibiotics, making treatment difficult. Bacteria in CF patients are usually characterized in a clinic by cultivation techniques, but culturing only identifies a fraction of bacteria. New developments in sequencing technology are revolutionizing the study of complex microbial communities. The goals of this project are to: 1) identify indicator bacteria and viruses whose change in abundance or diversity presage onset of a pulmonary exacerbation or other changes in patient health, 2) identify bacteria and viruses that are involved in disease progression, and 3) determine how antibiotics affect the microbial population in the lung. These goals serve as the foundation for development of personalized courses of treatment to manage infections. The two main techniques used to monitor the microbiota are Illumina sequencing and qPCR. In experiments analyzing sputum samples from a CF patient via Illumina sequencing and qPCR, the data indicate that 1) bacteria diversity can be high in CF patients not having an active infection, 2) while the presence of most taxa present in the lung change over time, a few specific pathogens are present in all samples, 3) bacterial diversity and abundance correlates with antibiotic treatment, and 4) standard antibiotic treatment does not remove all bacteria from the lung (see DOI: 10.1128/JCM.02555-14.).NIH funding was received to expand this study to 15 adolescent CF patients. Sample collection has ceased and data is currently being analyzed Research Funding Identifying Collateral Sensitivity Networks and Associated Genetic Markers in Burkholderia species.\u201d Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. $159,371, 1/15/20-7/15/21.

They provide coral with photosynthetically fixed carbon while the coral supplies the algae with inorganic nutrients and a haven from predation. Our laboratory is interested in answering fundamental questions about the biology and metabolism of dinoflagellates.In particular, we apply systems biology (metabolomics, transcriptomics, genomics), cell biology, and genetic approaches to understand coral-algal symbiosis and toxin biosynthesis in red tide dinoflagellates.

Other projects are focused on mechanistic understanding of viral replication cycle of NNS RNA viruses, which is fundamental to developing reagents to prevent and combat viral diseases.The orderMononegavirales includes many important human and animal pathogens, such as rabies, measles, Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, Hendra, and other viruses.

(a) Reverse genetics allows generation of a recombinant VSV encoding a foreign gene of interest between the VSV G and L genes. The asterisk above M indicates M protein mutation(s) resulting in VSV attenuation in normal cells. Plasmids encoding VSV replication machinery and the modified genome are co-transfected into a cell line, and complete virions are produced and amplified using good manufacturing practices. (b) For evaluation of oncolytic efficacy, VSV can be administered directly, via cell-based delivery, or in combination with other treatments (chemotherapy, radiotherapy or other OVs). (c) In infected cells, VSV recombinants may express a foreign gene that facilitates killing of the adjacent uninfected cancer cells (e.g. suicide-gene approach or immunostimulation). Innate antiviral responses and other mechanisms prevent cell death in normal cells. Ideally, stimulation of innate and adaptive immune cells by VSV and/or the foreign gene product should lead to tumour-specific immune responses, including memory responses that prevent cancer recurrence.

The introduction of fluorine substituents in the arene pincers alters the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) in the binding cavity \u2013 in contrast to almost all known molecular tweezers the MEP is inverted \u2013 and thus induces a selectivity for electron-rich guests, e.g., electron-rich arenes or anions. The non-covalent p-p and anion-p interactions between the tweezers and guest units are of fundamental importance in supramolecular chemistry with potential applications in biology, chemistry and their interface. Novel fluorinated molecular tweezers will therefore significantly expand experimental data for molecular recognition that is based on the aforementioned supramolecular binding motifs. Ultimately we target sensing and sequestration of biologically important and environmentally hazardous species, respectively. b) Strained cage hydrocarbons have traditionally played an important role in (physical) organic chemistry and the group investigates neglected cage olefins. The study of their photochemistry toward more complex structures, the reactivity mode of the olefin units (1,2-; 1,4- vs. laticyclic addition) as well as the preparation of new organometallic complexes are central topics of our endeavors.

Quinlan (Ph.D., Ohio University) is a Professor of Communication and a Core Faculty Member of the Interdisciplinary Health Psychology Ph.D. Program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Dr. Quinlan is the Director of an Interdisciplinary Minor, Health/Medical Humanities and received the Bonnie E. Cone Early Career Professorship in Teaching (2015-2018). She explores how communication creates, resists and transforms knowledges about bodies. She critiques power structures in order to empower individuals who are marginalized inside and outside of healthcare systems. Additionally, her scholarly work explores the organizing of health care resources and work opportunities for people with lived differences. Dr. Quinlan authored approximately 40 journal articles, 17 book chapters and co-produced documentaries in a regional Emmy award-winning series (National Distribution with PBS and available on Amazon). Dr. Quinlan has published in Health Communication,Text & Performance Quarterly, Disability Studies Quarterly, Communication Education, Women & Language, Women\u2019s ReproductiveHealth, Qualitative Research in Medicine and Healthcare, International Journal of Health and Media Research, Sexuality & Culture, Journal of Research in Special Education Needs, and Journal of Holistic Nursing. She co-authored a book with Bethany Johnson:You\u2019re doing it wrong! Mothering, media, and medical expertise with Rutgers University Press. You\u2019re Doing it Wrong!investigates the storied history of expertise around mothering in the media, from the newspapers, magazines, doctors\u2019 records and personal papers of the nineteenth century to today\u2019s websites, Facebook groups, and Instagram feeds. Johnson and Quinlan find surprising parallels between today\u2019s mothering experts and their Victorian counterparts, but they also explore how social media has placed unprecedented pressures on new mothers wrestling with familiar concerns and crises from pre-conception through early toddlerhood.

Prior to joining the faculty at UNCCharlotte, Dr. Phillips served as an analyst and methodologist for the US Intelligence Community. His research interests span three broad areas. The first area of research concerns transnational organized crime, to include international drug trafficking, terrorism, and human trafficking. He has recently been investigating the intersection between drug trafficking and terrorist activity cross-nationally, and the phenomenon of narco-terrorism in Latin America and Southwest Asia. He has published case studies on the Islamic State and the Taliban, and was recently featured in the Washington Post. His transnational crime research is also heavily concerned with human trafficking, and has investigated the international prosecution of human trafficking, as well as the facilitation of commercial sex trafficking through the internet, social media, and the deep web. A second area of research is in the applications of big data\u201d and data analytic initiatives to the study of crime, particularly within the realm of national security. His emerging work in this area seeks to understand how data analytics can supplement the traditional mathematical and statistical techniques used in criminological research, and how these tools can be leveraged by governmental and law enforcement agencies. The final area of research involves the relationship between individual drug offending and delinquency, primarily violent offending. He has tested these relationships using data from the Rochester Youth Development Study, an on-going longitudinal panel study of youth at high risk for violence and delinquency. He has also used data from this project to study criminological research methods, statistics, and quantitative analytic techniques. To inform this research, Dr. Phillips draws heavily from Interactional Theory.

In terms of his research interests, he has published articles and received grants to fund his research in three broad areas.The first area of research involves testing criminological theories. He has published several articles testing different criminological theories but has focused most of his energies understanding the development and nature of self-control. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, he has contributed to our understanding of the various sources of the development of one\u2019s self-control as well as the nature of how self-control changes (or does not) over the life course. More recently, he has worked on a project to understand cheating behaviors of college students from a Rational Choice perspective.  A second area of research involves understanding college campus-related risky behaviors. He has published several articles related to understanding the nature and extent of sexual victimization as it occurs on college campuses. More recently, he has been awarded a grant from the U.S. Department of Education to implement and evaluate an educational intervention to reduce the rate of binge drinking on college campuses. Finally, a third area of research involves understanding resiliency and desistance from delinquency and crime. Again, using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, he has published work which has documented the importance of the accumulation of protection over the life course. More recently, he has embarked on understanding the importance of how protection varies across categories of race and sex to instigate resiliency.

For example, he has published articles examining the effects of alcohol and anger on violent decision-making within a rational choice perspective. He has also examined how personality traits influence decisions to engage in such crimes as corporate offending and sexual assault.

The question \u2018What is a child?\u2019 feeds invariably into the next question: \u2018What language does a child need?\u2019 Those two questions have generated substantially different kinds of children\u2019s literature. I am looking specifically at the Bureau of Educational Experiments (BEE, founded 1916 in NYC). It answered the first question with: \u2018Children have innate skills: a poetic sensibility for language, whole-body sensorimotor learning, and exceptional observational acuity. If those skills are preserved rather than suppressed (read: in traditional school settings), those children will grow up to be future writers, artists, and scientists.\u2019 That answer generated a very interesting response to the second question: \u2018Children need language specifically designed for their skill levels at successive maturational periods (infancy through 7 years).\u2019 Interdisciplinary scientific testing and experimenting with stories and manuscripts led, over the following 30 years, to the development of age-appropriate children\u2019s literature, with a trajectory of best-selling authors leading from Lucy Sprague Mitchell to Margaret Wise Brown and Dorothy Meserve Kunhardt. Authors like Gertrude Stein and Theodor Seuss Geisel\u2013whether they acknowledged it or not\u2013also profited from the paths broken at BEE, as can be established from the novel linguistic profiles of their children\u2019s books.

I have extensive teaching, production and project management experience in Cartography as well. I have served as a research analyst and community outreach specialist for the Department of Justice\u2019s Project Safe Neighborhoods, where I made use of police, sheriff, corrections, school, social, health, and juvenile justice data, plus interviews, and site visits with community residents and non-profit organizations to study root causes of juvenile delinquency and to recommend, write grants for, and evaluate intervention and prevention strategies from culture, gender and faith-relevant perspectives. I have a heart for service to the intervention and prevention of juvenile delinquency, with special compassion for those youth who find themselves most marginalized and disenfranchised from school, community, peers and society at large, and those who are system-involved.

I am a geography lecturer in the Department of Geography and Earth Sciences at UNC Charlotte and I absolutely love what I do! I am an avid life-long learner and teaching is my passion. I believe the field of geography is one of the most important and practical disciplines in existence and I strive to instill in my students a curiosity about this dynamic planet we call home. In my courses, I encourage the development of geographic thinking as we examine the why of where\u201d and the interconnections between the natural environment and society. My mission is to inspire students to achieve their best and empower them to not only create the life they desire, but to discover what impact on our planet and its people they can accomplish in their lives. The opportunity to positively impact students and geo-evangelize\u201d young minds is the most gratifying aspect of my career. If you have questions about Geography or Environmental Studies courses, majors or minors or simply want to discuss career aspirations or graduate school, please feel free to email me or stop by my office.

Myresearch interests center on surface processes, soils, weathering and landscape evolution on Earth. I have a particular interest in mechanical weathering. See this 18 min video for an overview of some of that work. I study both stress-loading processes like thermal cycling (Eppes et al., 2016); as well as how the mechanics of subcritical cracking \u2013 the type of cracking that likely drives all weathering \u2013 translates into measurable weathering (Eppes and Keanini, 2017; Aldred et al., 2015) and geomorphic phenomena like rock erosion, river incision or exfoliation (e.g. Shobe et al., 2017; Eppes et al., 2018; Collins et al., 2018). I also have a strong interest in the late Quaternary geology of the southern San Juan mountains and Piedmont of the southeastern United States. My students and I use soils to map and date surficial deposits like alluvial fans and terraces; and put the results in the context of climate change on Earth. I am currently conducting research in Antarctica (see figure from my trip), the Piedmont of South and North Carolina, the Blue Ridge of Virginia, granite domes of California and the Eastern United States and the alpine environments of the San Juan Mountains of Colorado (see below). I am always looking for good students for any of these graduate degree programs: MS in Earth Sciences; PhD in Geography; and PhD in INES \u2013 a joint program with Civil Engineering. TA positions are currently available. UNC Charlotte has openings for a Postdoctoral Researcher (2 year appointment \u2013 Application Deadline Nov 1, 2021) for U.S. Citizen applicants from women and other underrepresented groups.

I grew up in central Indiana and became fascinated with the weather at anyoung age. My early motivation in meteorology was to study the Antarctic ozone hole, but a series of circumstances and opportunities during my pursuit of an undergraduate degree at Purdue University pulled me toward hurricanes and severe weather. Since then, I have never looked back. During graduate school at Colorado State University, I had the opportunity to visit the NOAA Hurricane Research Division on an annual basis and to participate in their field program, during which they fly through tropical cyclones \u2014 an incredible experience! Since completing my graduate studies, livingin Florida, Iowa, and North Carolina has diversified my scientific interests into the societal impacts of weather and urban meteorology. As a scientist, I\u2019m interested in the physical processes that influence the formation and evolution of atmospheric systems. To this end, my general research interests encompass all aspects of tropical cyclones, organized mesoscale weather systems, and the influence of weather/climate on society and ecosystems. My specific research has focused on (1) understanding how elevated terrain can influence the structure and intensity of severe storms; (2) forecasting thunderstorm-induced power outages; (3) impacts of urban meteorology and the urban heat island on urban energy use and urban ecosystems; (4) relationships between the mosquito-transmitted dengue fever virus and weather variability across tropical regions; (5) understanding the ingredients favorable for supercell and tornado formation within a landfalling tropical cyclone circulation; (6) evaluating the use of micropalentological proxies to reconstruct the paleotempestology of hurricane landfalls; and (7) understanding the structure and evolution of tropical cyclones including eyewall convection and miniature supercells in outer rainbands. My teaching interests includethe areas of tropical, mesoscale, radar, urban, and synopticmeteorology, as well asatmospheric thermodynamics and instrumentation. I also teach a professional development seminar for seniors. Lastly, I am a faculty adviser for the Student Organization of Meteorology (STORM), which is a student chapter of the American Meteorology Society (AMS) and the National Weather Association (NWA).

(1995) Geology, University of Delaware  Profile I joined UNC Charlotte in 2000 after completing my MS and PhD in Geology at the University of Delaware. For my first decade in North Carolina my research centered on using fossils to solve environmental problems. The published results of this research included journal articles and book chapters concerning paleotempestology (the study of ancient storms), bioturbation (the mixing of sediments by critters), military geoarchaeology (of the barrier islands surrounding Charleston, SC) and Earth Sciences pedagogy. In 2004 I joined the research team in Charleston studying the most fascinating Civil War artifact I have ever seen: The Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley. My research pertaining to the submarine involves using microfossils to interpret the sediment infilling history of the vessel and provide insights into the reasons for the exceptional preservation of the crew.  This interest in the relationship between geology and the American Civil War is reflected in my current research agenda and publications. In addition to several recent journal articles on the geology of Civil War battlefields and landscapes, I have also completed my first book. This text, with the working-title Rocks and Rifles: The Influence of Geology on the Combat and Tactics of the American Civil War, is intended for audiences interested in either American history or geology (or, hopefully, both) and will be published by Springer-Nature this fall.

About me: I grew up in rural western PA and had the opportunity to live 18 years on the western slopes of the Appalachian Mountains, downwind of Lake Erie \u2013 so my love of meteorology started with lake effect snow and only grew from there! Growing up in PA, the obvious choice of college for me was Penn State and their great meteorology program. I graduated with a BS (2002) and an MS (2004) degree in meteorology and amassed quite a bit of teaching experience as both a lab instructor and general education instructor. My graduate work focused on atmospheric oxidation in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) and how to improve air quality in large metro centers. After graduation, I taught for one year at Bloomsburg University in north-eastern PA in their geography department, teaching both meteorology and physical geography courses. In the summer of 2006, I moved to Charlotte, NC and began my career at UNC Charlotte as a Meteorologist/Senior Lecturer in the Department of Geography and Earth Sciences and became part of a great team of atmospheric scientists in a program that we\u2019ve worked so hard to build and expand!

By looking at a small domain with a scattered territory, I hope to find new answers to the question of what constituted a domain in Bakumatsu-era Japan, considering factors such as commerce, knowledge production and Western Learning, as well as occupational and local identity. This time, I am following reform initiatives that connected \u014cno to such places as Osaka, Edo, Tsuruga, Hakodate, and Karafuto (Sakhalin). I am currently examining how the domain, in the course of these reforms, relied on social groups that formed networks across domain borders: wholesalers, shipping agents, sailors, lacquer harvesters and -dealers, miners, non-Japanese people on Karafuto, and others.

Lansen is Teaching Professor and Director of Undergraduate Studies of the Department of History at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. As such, he oversees the departmental undergraduate program of nearly 400 majors and 100 minors. In addition, Oscar directs the Department\u2019s first-year program; and co-coordinates the six semi-annual University graduation ceremonies. He is a member of the Honors Faculty (and former Chair of the Honors Council), the Academic Integrity Board; and the Faculty Council. Oscar holds an affiliate appointment with the University\u2019s Center for Holocaust, Genocide, and Human Rights Studies.  Scholarship Oscar\u2019s scholarly interests lay in Dutch Holocaust History and in the pedagogy of history and teaching. As a scholar of the Holocaust, Oscar researches the plight of Jewish refugees to Latin America; in particularly Dutch-Jewish relations in the Netherlands and its overseas territories in the West. He has published on various aspects of the Holocaust in Dutch, English, and Spanish language journals; and participated in continuing scholarly exchanges \u2013 including appearances as Dutch national radio and most recently at Yad Vashem\u2019s School for International Holocaust Studies in Jerusalem. Oscar recently completed a Holocaust Education Foundation Grant to make Shoah education more widely available to college students. This coming year, he will serve as a staff historian on a Second Generation Holocaust Survivor testimonial project to preserve the familial eyewitness narrative. As pedagogue, Oscar\u2019s interests lay in teaching the unmasterable past; and in active learning didactics. Oscar has participated as part of the Eurclio study group reviewing and assisting the national curriculae in Latvia and Malta. Most recently he completed a study on immigration, education and vision of nationhood in the United States. Beside developing experiential source/experience-driven curricula on national and local levels, Oscar has developed visual-spatial analysis strategies for large lecture classroom settings and integrated freshmen/discipline-specific skill development techniques to transition, retain, and academically accelerate potentially vulnerable student populations. At UNC Charlotte, Oscar pioneered the freshmen-only experiential learning curriculae for small and large classroom settings for general and for honors students. Currently, history freshmen co-teach his seminar on the Holocaust. Oscar is a founding member of the Charlotte Teacher Institute, is editorial advisor to the didactical Journal Teaching History; and has given workshops and consulted on curriculae in the United States, Europe, and Asia. In addition, he serves in several leadership roles for the Advanced Placement European History exam development and reading. Oscar\u2019s research in history and pedagogy has been supported in part by internal and external grants and fellowships.  Teaching As a teacher, Oscar focuses on the impact of war and conflict on society; offering experiential topics, methods, and honors courses in seminar and large-lecture format on Children in War and Conflict; When Nations go to War; War and Peace in Modern Times; World War II; The Holocaust; Nazi Germany; Propaganda; and Teaching History. He is the co-recipient of several National Endowment of the Humanities Teaching Fellowships on minority perspectives in history, the experience of soldiers and civilians in war, and America in a global perspective. Oscar has received local and national awards for his teaching and service to education.  Community Besides the university classroom and peer training, Oscar frequently guest-lectures in middle and high schools; as well as offers a range of community lectures. The latter have included topics like The Vietnam-American War; How to Stop a Terrorist; The Churches and the Holocaust; The Jews of Curacao; The Mind of Adolf Hitler; and When Children go to War. He assisted in creating community-university partnerships to connect Liberal Arts with the business community and provide study-abroad grants for need-based undergraduates.

Instead of structuring state\u2013press relations through the dichotomies of power versus freedom and/or surveillance versus sedition, it imagines it as one in which newspapers served simultaneously as imprimaturs, mediators, and adversaries in relation to the state. Coercive the colonial state undoubtedly was; however, precisely because of its unrepresentative, top-heavy and remote nature, it also relied extensively \u2013 if not exclusively \u2013 on newspapers for some of its most urgent public needs: whether of representing itself as a legitimate sovereign power in India, of securing favourable reception for its endless stream of interventions, or of accessing enough local information to determine what administrative imperatives would drive its policy decisions. Attuned to such vulnerabilities and needs, journalists patently recognized their necessity to a colonial apparatus and the negotiating power that it engendered; however, they remained cognizant of the wide range of executive powers that the state still held over them. It was in this nebulous, uneven, and rapidly shifting landscape that the practical, everyday, relationship between state and press was negotiated, through a series of transactions that recognized the institutional power and constraints of both. As this book explores, many of the structures of modern governmentality and of its relationship with the modern press in India were produced within this thrust and parry, in which power could be monopolized by neither side, and in which the very mechanisms of regulation, control, and surveillance available to the state were deployed by journalists to recalibrate the relationship, whether in terms of the minutiae of their profession \u2013 from postage to subsidies \u2013 or in terms of their ideological claims to public authority.

Raised in Seneca, SC, Maxwell-Roddey became a Charlotte desegregation/Black Studies torchbearer as the first Black women principal of a white elementary school (1968) and the founding director of UNC Charlotte\u2019s Black Studies Program (1971). A cultural advocate, in 1974, she co-founded Charlotte\u2019s Afro-American Cultural and Service Center, now the $18 Million Harvey B. Gantt Center for African-American Art + Culture. As a national figure, Maxwell-Roddey served as a forerunner who helped to institutionalize the field of Black Studies as the founder of its premiere professional organization, the National Council for Black Studies (NCBS), in 1975. She also rose to become an innovative leader of one of the most influential Black women\u2019s organizations in the US as the 20th National President of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. (1992-96).

It combines a strong theory with numerical results, which are based on this theory. In particular, I have many publications which describe the work of our numerical methods on experimental data. MAIN MATHEMATICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:  In a breakthrough work of 1981 has introduced, for the first time,the powerful tool of Carleman estimates in the field of Multidimensional Coefficient Inverse Problems (MCIPs). Publication:A.L. Buhgeim and M.V. Klibanov, Global uniqueness of a class of multidimensional inverse problems, Soviet Mathematics Doklady, 24, 244-247, 1981.This tool has allowed, for the first time, to prove global uniqueness theorems for broad classes of MCIPs with the non over-determined data. Contrary to this, only local uniqueness theorems were proven for such MCIPs prior to that. This idea is called nowadays The Bukhgeim-Klibanov method\u201d. This method has generated many publications of many authors. Currently, this remains the single method, enabling one to prove global uniqueness and stability theorems for MCIPs with non over-determined data. In addition, this idea has generated effective numerical methods, which I have developed later with some of coauthors. Item 3 is an example of those methods. Recent survey on this method: M.V. Klibanov,Carleman estimates for global uniqueness, stability and numerical methods for coefficient inverse problems, J. Inverse and Ill-Posed Problems, 21, 477-560, 2013. In 1997 has started, for the first time, the development of globally convergent numerical methods (GCM) for coefficient inverse problems (CIPs). This research addresses the following crucial question: How to rigorously obtain at least one point in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the exact solution without any advanced knowledge of this neighborhood? Two GCMs have been developed: (1) The so-called tail functions method and (2) The convexification method. Both are currently verified on experimental data. Both work with non-redundant data. All other numerical methods for coefficient inverse problems which work with non redundant data, converge onlylocally. The convergence of a locally convergent method to the exact solution is rigorously guaranteed only if the starting point of iterations is located in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the exact solution. This means that locally convergent numerical methods are inherently unstable, since solutions they deliver critically depend on the starting points for iterations. My current interest is in the convexification. The convexification constructs a weighted Tikhonov-like functional for a CIP. The weight is the Carleman Weight Function. This is the function which is involved in the Carleman estimate for the underlying Partial Differential Operator. Given a ball B(R) of an arbitrary radius R>0 in an appropriate Hilbert space, one can choose the parameter of the CWF in such a way that the above functional becomes strictly convex on B(R). The strict convexity, in turn, implies convergence to the exact solution of the gradient projection method. It is CRUCIAL that the starting point of this method is an arbitrary point of B(R). Since, in turn R>0 is an arbitrary number, then this is the GLOBAL convergence. In 2014 has proved, for the first time,uniqueness theorems for 3-d Inverse Scattering Problems without the phase information. Applications are in imaging of nanostructures and living biological cells. The first publication:M.V. Klibanov, Phaseless inverse scattering problems in three dimensions, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 74, 392-410, 2014. In 2015 has developed (jointly with V.G. Romanov), for the first time, reconstruction methods for3-d Inverse Scattering Problems without the phase information. One of those methods was computationally implemented. The first publication:M.V. Klibanov and V.G. Romanov, Reconstruction procedures for two inverse scattering problems without the phase information, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 76, 178-196, 2016. In particular, items 4 and 5 have solved a long standing problem posed by K. Chadan and P.C. Sabatier in in their bookInverse Problems in Quantum Scattering Theory, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1977. In 2016 has proposed the first rigorous numerical method for solving ill-posed Cauchy problems for quasilinear PDEs. The method is an an adaptation of the convexification. Previously ill-posed Cauchy problems were solved only for linear PDEs. Publication:M.V. Klibanov, Carleman weight functions for solving ill-posed Cauchy problems for quasilinear PDEs, Inverse Problems, 31, 125007, 2015. In 2016 has proposed a new mathematical model for the Black-Scholes equation. It was shown on real market data for 368 randomly chosen stock options that this model indeed helps to be quite profitable. Publication: M.V. Klibanov, A.V. Kuzhuget and K.V. Golubnichiy,An ill-posed problem for the Black\u2013Scholes equation for a profitable forecast of prices of stock options on real market data, Inverse Problems, 32, 015010, 2016. In 1991 has introduced, for the first time, the powerful tool of Carleman estimates in the Control Theory via proving the Lipschitz stability property for hyperbolic equations with the Cauchy data at the lateral side of the time cylinder and the book (initial conditions at t=0 are absent in this case). This idea became a common place since then in the Control Theory. Publication:M. V. Klibanov and J. Malinsky, Newton-Kantorovich method for 3-dimensional potential inverse scattering problem and stability for the hyperbolic Cauchy problem with time dependent data, Inverse Problems 7, 577\u2013596, 1991.

Why is chill\u201d music or lofi beats to study/relax to\u201d popular now? What are the hidden consequences of using musical and sonic metaphors for black box algorithms?

I have written about musicians including: Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Paula Temple, Justin Bieber, James Chance, Peaches, Chicks On Speed, Nicki Minaj, Billie Eilish, LMFAO, Ludacris, Calvin Harris, and many more. I am co-editing the Oxford Handbook of Electronic Dance Music with Luis-Manuel Garcia (University of Birmingham, UK), and have been the co-editor of The Journal of Popular Music Studies from 2019-2021.

Astratov is a professor of Physics and Optical Science at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte. In 1986, he received his Ph.D. degree from the A.F. Ioffe Physical-Technical Institute in Russia. In this institute, he had accomplished a career as a research scientist, rising through the ranks from staff member (1981-1992), group leader (1992-1997), to senior member of staff in 1997. In the mid-90s, he pioneered studies of synthetic opals as novel self-assembled photonic crystals for visible light in his group at the Ioffe Institute. In 1997-2001, he was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Sheffield where he developed novel surface coupling techniques for studying photonic crystal waveguides and semiconductor microcavities. Since joining UNC-Charlotte in 2002, his research was devoted to microspherical photonics including super-resolution microscopy, resonant light forces, photonic nanojets, and photonic molecules. In his group, he developed the methods of super-resolution imaging based on using high-index dielectric microspheres immersed in liquids or in elastomeric slabs. These methods are widely used for imaging subcellular structures, viruses, and nanoplasmonic structures. He was a topical editor for the journal Optics Express in 2005-2011 and a program committee member for major international conferences including CLEO 2006-07 and 2012\u201315, IEEE Photonics 2014-17, OSA Advanced Photonics Congress 2016-17, Photonics West 2017-18, ICTON 2017-18 and OECC/ACOFT 2008 and 2014.

I define myself as a child clinical-community psychologist, and my primary professional interests focus on children and families. They include two main areas: (1) the development of children at-risk, in particular the examination of risk and resilience (i.e., effective coping and adaptation in the face of major life stress) and youngsters\u2019 adjustment to trauma; and (2) the use of evaluative research to guide system change, program refinement, service delivery, and policy. These interests drive my research, inform and complement my teaching, lead to opportunities for my students, and guide my service roles. Early in my training, I observed my mentors integrate research, service, and mentoring successfully. I resonated with the practical implications of community-based research and the critical need to conduct rigorous evaluations of community programs and initiatives. Indeed, I am drawn to my interest areas because they have real world\u201d relevance; I strive to make a heuristic contribution to the field and benefit my community. My other on-campus roles reflect these interests in drawing on our expertise here on campus to work with the community to address issues and promote the public good. In particular, I am serving as Senior Fellow for Faculty Engagement for the Office of Urban Research and Community Engagement as well as Director of the Social Aspects of Health Initiative for the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Here in Psychological Science, I co-direct the Community Psychology Research Lab. In addition to myundergraduate teaching and mentoring, Icontribute to the community psychology and clinical psychologyprograms within our health psychology doctoral program (including as co-coordinator of our community psychology concentration), as well as our M.A. program in Community Psychology.

There is strong evidence that mental, physical and sexual health are linked and yet, because their interplay is complex, there are still many unknowns. Can inflammation be the common cause of sex differences in depression, heart disease and chronic pain? How does information about our social and sexual relationships change how our body interprets immune threats? How do psychological interventions change the fight-or-flight response to sexual behavior in women with a history of childhood sexual abuse? What causes antidepressant sexual side effects, and how does antidepressant use change neural activity during reproductive transitions (puberty, postpartum, or menopause)? To answer these and other questions, my work uses methods from multiple fields, including measures of hormones and immune markers, psychophysiological measures of sexual and autonomic arousal, neural imaging, clinical trials, surveys and interviews. One line of my research considers how the interaction of sexual behavior and immunity may influence women\u2019s mental and physical health. Across these studies we are finding that women\u2019s bodies respond differently to immune challenges if they are sexually abstinent vs. sexually active. We are now following up on that research, looking for the mechanisms by which sexual activity impacts immune function. Another line of this research is measuring the effects of childhood sexual abuse on interactions between the endocrine and autonomic nervous system response to stress in adult survivors, including how sexual abuse may influence women\u2019s immune responses to sexual activity. In the other direction, I examine how physical and mental health conditions impact women\u2019s sexual and relationship function. In this track, we are mapping out the etiology and treatment of antidepressant sexual side effects, and examining how treatment for gynecologic cancer influences women\u2019s ongoing sexual wellbeing.

His courses explore the texts and questions that comprise feminist and queer theory, psychoanalysis, and the work of Georges Bataille.

He also serves as the North American editor forTheology and Sexuality. Much of his free time is dedicated to keeping his two dogs\u2013Dino and Bertha\u2013happy. Research My research focuses on the overlap and equivalence between religion and sexuality. Specifically, I am interested in how religious, erotic and aesthetic experiences and practices foster a disruption of the subject\u2019s coherence in a way that can respond to, and perhaps prevent, various forms of cultural violence.In pursuing these questions, I am guided bythe work of Georges Bataille, psychoanalysis and queer theory. In Ecce Homo, my first book, I considered constructions of masculine subjectivity and the evocation of homoerotic desire in relation to representations of the male-body-in-pain, including psychoanalytic discourses, images of crucifixion, paintings by Francis Bacon, photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe and films from the Hollywood action genre. InConstraining Violence, my current project, I extend this consideration by staging a conversation among Leo Bersani, Jean Laplanche, Bataille, and Lee Edelman to sketch the kinds of ethical frameworks and political analyses that might be generated by focusing on negativity, self-annihilation and the death drive. InFormalizing Desire, my next project, I will explore these same questions from the vantage point of mystical and pornographic writing, their shared stylistic and formal features, and their capacity to disrupt the reader\u2019s sense of a stable, coherent self.These questions will bepursued through comparative analyses of the Marquis de Sade and Hadewijch of Antwerp, Georges Bataille and Angela of Foligno, Jean Genet and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux, and Dennis Cooper and Pseudo-Dionysius.

Specifically, I\u2019ve focused on religion and class, mass media representations of religion, Third Wave Evangelicalism and Neoliberalism, religious and economic conceptions of agency, supernatural bricolage, paranormal beliefs and practices, and new religious movements. I\u2019ve written various journal articles, book chapters, and several books: American Possessions: Fighting Demons in the Contemporary United States (2015), Divine Hierarchies: Class in American Religion and Religious Studies (2007), and Making the American Religious Fringe: Exotics, Subversives, and Journalists, 1955-93 (2004). I am also co-editor of Religion and Class in America: Culture, History, and Politics (2009). I was the first in my rural, working-class, Indiana family to attend college and I continue to be interested in examining how social class both constrains and enables us in ways that we are not always consciously aware of. Outside of my academic work world, I have spent most of my life writing, playing, and enjoying music. I have sang and played guitar and bass in several punk and post-punk bands, including The Nids, Eleneki, Nat Turner, Moe/w, and Consumption Casualties.  Research and Teaching InterestsMy approach to studying religion is multidisciplinary and my research and teaching interests focus on social theory, ethnography, methods for the academic study of religions, the primary materials of American religions, and the cultural history of the study of religion in the United States. Three broad questions drive my work. First, I am interested in examining how religion in different contexts creates, maintains, or tears down boundaries and identities. Second, I am interested in how religion both enables and constrains our conceptions of the world. Third, I am fascinated by how religion itself is defined\u2014by academics, journalists, and practitioners\u2014and how such definitions work in social and cultural arenas to mark\u201d the status of different individuals and groups.

Her research efforts revolve around the central question of stratification research including who gets what and why do they get it? In her research, she has used this essential question to gain a better understanding of her substantive areas of education and race and ethnicity. In general, she investigates how inequality, particularly racial and ethnic inequality, is generated and sustained in the American educational system. Recently, her work has focused on gender and racial inequalities in higher education, particularly with regard to college majors.

The overall focus is improving the practicing engineer\u2019s ability to produce accurate components in a timely manner; this has important ramifications for both the private and defense sectors. Our approach is to perform fundamental research in support of this goal, while taking care to consider the practical implementation of our research efforts. Through this combined agenda, students from the high school to graduate levels are trained to have strong analytical/numerical modeling capabilities coupled withfundamental experimental techniques and data analysis skills.  Dr. Schmitz prepares a milling test.  While the historical focus of manufacturing research has been at the macro-scale, recent technological innovations have led to new research activities at both the micro- and nano-scales. This multi-scale manufacturing approach mirrors the current climate within the manufacturing industry which demands expertise at all length scales. We also recognize that manufacturing in the 21st  Displacement measuring interferometer setup  century requires knowledge in many areas, including structural dynamics, optics and photonics, precision design, heat transfer, uncertainty analysis,and metrology (the science of measurement), in order to develop process models and improve efficiency. An important example is the increased use of high-speed machining to produce discrete components in the aerospace, automotive, and biomedical industries from the micrometer to meter scales. This remains a cornerstone of our research efforts.
