As Carmen, Babcock made her French debut with the Festival Lyrique-en-Mer and has performed the role with companies such as Florentine Opera, Nashville Opera, Florida Grand Opera, New York City Opera, San Antonio Opera, Knoxville Opera, Opera Delaware, Toledo Opera, Anchorage Opera,\u00a0Dayton Opera,\u00a0Fort Worth Opera, Mill City Summer Opera, and Utah Festival Opera and most recently with Bar Harbor Music Festival where she completed her 115th performance of the fiercest of the Femme Fatales.    Babcock discerns her research focuses along two tracts; the physical mechanisms of the breathing apparatus as pertains to the act of singing and specific arenas of musical history. To the singing mechanism, Ms. Babcock\u2019s research pertains to the pelvic floor, pelvic health, and its tangible use in partnership with the deconstruction of breath. She is unpacking the relationship of the pelvic diaphragm to the global singing instrument from laryngeal stabilization to simultaneous neurological calm and full-bodied sonic vitality. Embodying these tools, Babcock\u2019s Masterclass series,\u00a0The Full-Bodied Voice, has brought her to colleges and Young Artist programs across the US and abroad from Fort Worth Opera to California Institute of the Arts. The series, from inspiration to creation, directly addresses how life and society has retrained the perfect breath we were born to take. From the ancient traditions of Kundalini Yoga and other kinesthetic practices she\u00a0takes these tools from practice to performance. Babcock\u2019s other arena of research involves bringing historical music and language into a modern context investigating Sephardic music, the Ladino language, and music created prior to and through the diaspora (post expulsion from Spain). The cross-pollination of Arabic (Moorish), Catholic, and Jewish art and culture in Spain circa 1400 A.D., as well as the following aurally transmitted diasporic song tradition, are her specific focuses.\u00a0 Having spent much time under the tutelage of the late Nico Castel (who wrote the first book of ladino songs widely available to the public), her first album,\u00a0Songs for Carmen, was born.\u00a0SFC, a concept album, recorded under her Hebrew name,\u00a0Aviva, hinges on the legend that the original Carmen may have been a Sephardic Jew and not a Gypsy. Babcock\u2019s concert series,\u00a0Beyond Carmen, her work with the ensemble\u00a0Flamenco Sephardit\u00a0and her Choreopoem \u2013\u00a0Carmen; Shadow of my Shadow, are all beneficiaries and extensions of this life-long pursuit.

She subsequently worked as a bioinformatics analyst and programmer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. In 1999, she took a faculty position at Virginia Tech and was involved in the development of their Bioinformatics graduate programs and the initial formation of the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute. In 2005, she moved to UNC Charlotte. Her expertise is in genomic data analysis, visualization and integration with experience in analysis of next-gen sequencing data, genome assembly, comparative genomics, transcriptomics, molecular biophysics, and molecular modeling. Google Scholar Profile Research Description: Dr. Gibas\u2019 current research is focused on development of automated methods for probe and target selection and microarray data analysis. Her research group is developing analytical methods that will take into account the biophysical properties of molecules involved in the array experiment. This work attempts to connect the real physical behavior of molecules to microarray experiment outcomes, and to eliminate confounding factors based on accurate models of molecular behavior. Microarrays are now so commonly used that providing new methods and standards for their use impacts broadly across many fields of molecular biology research. Long oligonucleotide microarrays the class of arrays that we are studying, are increasingly commonly used, and yet it is not known whether the parameters used to model hybridization reactions are valid in the microarray context. Complete hybridization of each target molecule to its intended probe is taken for granted, in a milieu where many competing binding scenarios may be equally valid. Dr. Gibas\u2019 major funding is from the NIH; the project is titled \u201cBiophysical Optimization of Oligonucleotide Microarrays\u201d. Dr. Gibas\u2019 other research interests include development of devices for measuring hybridization in real time, application of visual analytics approaches to comparative genomics, and development of accurate molecular diagnostics.

Evidence supports operationalizing effective practice and knowledge in terms of observable teacher-student interactions. We can improve teacher-student interactions by providing teachers with explicit evaluations, feedback, and training. However, teacher improvement efforts must be supported by reliable, valid measurement and rigorous research designs. In my research program, I seek to 1) measure teachers\u2019 practice of effective teacher-student interactions through observations that are reliable and valid, 2) measure teachers\u2019 knowledge of effective interactions related to observed teacher practice and to student outcomes, and 3) identify processes that improve teachers\u2019 practice and knowledge of effective teacher-student interactions in school contexts.

Specifically, he is in the process of developing a low-cost biomechanical ankle assessment tool for clinicians and developing low-cost gait retraining instruments. Overall, his goal is to improve function and quality of life over the long term in patients with CAI and to develop prevention strategies that can be implemented in youth sports and in the general population to reduce the injury rates of lateral ankle sprains.

Impaired skeletal muscle regeneration is one component of sarcopenia. Notch and Wnt signaling are suggested to be dysfunctional during regeneration of aged skeletal muscle. It is of interest to determine the effect of models of biological muscle injury (physiological stimuli) on Notch and Wnt signaling during aged skeletal muscle repair. Dr. Arthur\u2019s research agenda consists of examining the influence of Notch and Wnt signaling during repair of aged skeletal muscle that was exposed to physiological stimuli (exercise, muscle lengthening, hypertrophy). In addition, Dr. Arthur is investigating the interaction of Notch and Wnt signaling with muscle proteins that may be important for myogenesis (Msx1 Foxk1). In a collaboration with Appalachian State (Kevin Zwetsloot and Andy Shanely) Dr. Arthur and their team are studing the effect of the naturally-produced phytoecdysteroids from Ajuga turkestanica as a countermeasure against sarcopenia. Dr. Arthur is collaborating with colleagues at UNC Charlotte, Drs. Reuben Howden, Scott Gordon and Yvette Huet as well as neighboring research institutions and universities: Nury Steurwald (Carolina Medical Center), Andy Shanely and Kevin Zwetsloot (Appalachian State University including North Carolina Research Center).

I have realized that the development of healthy lifestyles often begins at infancy and continues through the stages of life (i.e. infancy, childhood, adolescence, early adulthood, adulthood, and older adult), thus it is crucial to understand health differences across the lifespan. In an attempt to better explain the multiple determinants associated with a specific condition, my research agenda integrates a life course approach to the study of chronic diseases and contributes to the advancement of my expertise in the field. Several chronic conditions have been linked, in part, to fetal environment, which include the following: hypertension, type 2 diabetes, asthma, prostate cancer, obesity, cognition, and stroke.

I am an internationally recognized expert on active life expectancy, a central public health indicator that measures life expectancy and the proportions of life with and without disability or disease. The United States and countries throughout the world use active life expectancy to assess population health, and to develop and evaluate health policies. Researchers throughout the world use methods that I helped to develop to study active life expectancy, which use panel survey data combined with Markov models and microsimulation. Microsimulation creates simulated populations that mirror the characteristics of actual populations. With the simulated populations researchers can follow individuals and groups throughout life. This provides new knowledge about the dynamics of health and disability, as well as factors that may help to increase access to health care, address health disparities, and promote well-being. Microsimulation addresses complex research questions that cannot be studied effectively using more conventional methods. My current research examines life expectancy, active life expectancy, disability, chronic disease, and developmental disability using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID, 1968-present), the longest running household survey in the world. These data allow me to follow individuals through all life stages, and families both across households and through several generations. I have published more than 150 peer-reviewed research studies, and have mentored students as coauthors on more than half of those publications. My CV includes my publications. I am a Fellow of the Gerontological Society of America. I serve on the Editorial Boards of: Disability and Health Journal, Journal of Women & Aging, and Journals of Gerontology Social Sciences. My research has been funded by the National Institute on Aging, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Health Resources and Services Administration. I have substantial professional practice experience in both public health and the personal health care system. I have supervised numerous program evaluations for public health agencies, schools of medicine, and health care organizations. In academic leadership, I led Master of Health Administration (MHA) Programs, 2003 to 2011, as the MHA Program Director, mentored more than 650 graduate students of health administration, and led successful re-accreditation initiatives involving the Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education (CAHME) at the University of South Carolina (2005) and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (2010).
