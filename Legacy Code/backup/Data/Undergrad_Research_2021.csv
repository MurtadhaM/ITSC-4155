"A Breadcrumb Network for Assisting with Autonomous Robot Localization","Grabowsky, David",2021,"Localization and communication are critical components for functioning autonomous robots. The infrastructure required or these operations commonly includes global positioning system (GPS) and easily recognizable and re-identifiable landmarks. However, these types of infrastructures are not always readily available. GPS typically uses a low power signal that can be denied intentionally or is unable to penetrate certain materials. Unique landmarks can be difficult to find in unstructured environments like forests, where many potential landmarks can seem nearly identical. To solve this, this research has developed a deploy-able electronic way-point system dubbed ’BreadCrumbs’. BreadCrumbs function as electronic landmarks that can provide localization and communication capabilities to a robot in environments where such infrastructure is not present. When deployed by a forward moving agent with a set destination, the BreadCrumbs also form a series of way-points which reduce the possible state space an autonomous robot must search through when path planning in an unknown or un-mapped environment. The BreadCrumbs are self localizing and have several methods for initial location determination based on the environment they are placed in. GPS is not required for the BreadCrumbs to function and, once established, they can function as landmarks for autonomous robots by providing range data from radio signal strength with a path loss exponent determined through a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm. The algorithm is designed such that a path loss exponent for each BreadCrumb location is learned during run time."
"A Cold Pot Does Not Boil: A Case Study Of The Virginia Beach City Municipal Center Shooting To Understand Disgruntled Employee Violence","Bynum, Karly",2021,"The phenomenon of the violent disgruntled employee is a symptom of increasing mass violence in the U.S. Previous literature on mass violence in the workplace is mostly based on the individual psychologization of attackers. This case study is a reaction to the need for organizational leaders and scholars to critically address (1) the relationship between institutional environments and the development of violence, and (2) why pre-attack behaviors fail to trigger risk response thresholds in some organizations. This study of the Virginia Beach City Municipal Center workplace shooting ends with a discussion of a new approach to understand the cultural, structural, and larger socioeconomic influences that contributed to a violent outcome. The analysis uses high-reliability organizational theory as a central framework to understand how sensemaking within the organizational culture of Virginia Beach City enabled the conditions for violence to occur, and for the pre-attack warning signs to be missed. A focus on organizational culture departs from the dominant focus on individual risk factors and implicates a new critical exploration of how organizational culture can provoke or enable workplace violence in bureaucratic organizations."
"A Comprehensive Study of Drinking Water Coagulation with Aluminum Sulfate","Alansari, Amir",2021,"Coagulation is usually the first and most important step in conventional drinking water treatment processes. The efficiency of all downstream processes is directly dependent on the effectiveness of the coagulation stage. Coagulants such as aluminum sulfate (alum) have been used for treating drinking water for over a century now. Since the early 1900s, researchers have been studying coagulants in hopes of understanding the mechanisms by which they help remove contaminants from water. Despite the significant contributions and breakthroughs by many researchers, we still rely on a trial-and-error process (jar testing) to optimize coagulation. Accurately modeling the coagulation process has been nearly impossible because water is a chemically complex medium that varies spatially and temporally. There are also many competing and interacting factors that influence how coagulants interact with contaminants and the resulting overall treatment efficiency. This research aimed to develop an accurate computer model for coagulation with aluminum sulfate with practical, real-world applications. The study identified and addressed five primary challenges related to the study and modeling of coagulation. The five challenges were as follows: (1) independently control water quality parameters, (2) isolate the effects of coagulation dose and pH, (3) standardize the jar test procedure, (4) identify performance metrics that are scalable and independent of jar test mixing parameters, and (5) establish effective optimization strategies. A design of experiments approach was used to create 16 synthetic waters based on four water quality factors (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), alkalinity, and turbidity) at two discrete levels. An extensive dataset was built by measuring the performance at 1,632 unique combinations of water quality and coagulation conditions where all relevant coagulation factors – water quality, coagulation conditions, and mixing parameters – were tightly controlled. The measured performance metrics were settled and filtered water turbidity, DOC, UV254, zeta potential, and total chemical costs. Efforts to predict turbidity removals using simple regression models were unsuccessful. The regression models considered ranged from linear regression models with varying complexity to more advanced regression models based on machine learning such as support vector machines and gaussian process regression. When tested on a new water (i.e., one that was not used to train the model), the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the predicted turbidity ranged between 28 – 37%, while the R2 values ranged between 0.41 – 0.64. It was apparent that regression models could not model all the complex underlying non-linear behaviors of the coagulation process. On the other hand, a deep neural network (DNN) trained on the same dataset produced acceptable results. The RMSE and R2 values of the trained neural network (on the test dataset) were 9.6% and 0.88, respectively. The user input parameters were only DOC, SUVA, alkalinity, and turbidity of the raw water. More importantly, the trained neural could generate a contour plot (a process that requires 17 jar tests to produce experimentally) that correctly predicted the size and shape of the effective coagulation boundaries with acceptable accuracy. Similarly, the model correctly predicted the behavior of the coagulation process to changes in water quality conditions (e.g., an increase in SUVA). The trained neural network could also predict full-scale filtered turbidity removals within ±1.4% at 11 different drinking water treatment plants under cold and warm water conditions. It should be emphasized that these results were obtained simply by providing raw water quality parameters. The model was only trained to predict filtered water turbidity removals using synthetic waters. It can be concluded that deep neural networks are ideally suited for modeling complex drinking water treatment problems such as coagulation, a task in the past considered to be virtually impossible."
"A Critical, Empirical, and Reflexive Investigation of the Promise of Democratization in the Making Phenomenon","Okerlund, Johanna",2021,"Many endeavors in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) align themselves with the promise of the democratization of technology production, a promise that has yet to be fulfilled due to gaps in access and underlying power dynamics. HCI has recently seen new glimmers of the promise of democratized technology production in the making phenomenon. In this dissertation, I present a normative theory project grounded in my experience of starting and running a university makerspace that engages with the concept of democratization directly. To construct and develop the Normative Theory of Human-Centered Making (NTHCM), I derived a definition of democratization, developed an argument for a shift in values to better meet that definition, and conducted a series of empirical studies to understand how the theory relates to practice. I then used feminist utopianism as a definition of democratization to evaluate the theory and reflect more broadly on the merits and challenges of this theory in light of HCI's promise of democratization. Overall, I found that while the NTHCM is grounded in a definition of democratization and grounded in relation to maker practices, it does not guide towards or capture democratization to a sufficient extent, nor does it relate directly enough to maker practices to shed light on how to shift them. However, it is useful nonetheless as a reflective lens for makers, makerspace leaders, and HCI researchers on maker practices and contexts. I also found that feminist utopianism, the construct I had planned to measure the NTHCM against, has merit as an alternate way of pursuing some of the same goals as the NTHCM. I reflect on the similarities and differences between the NTHCM and feminist utopianism and discuss how underlying assumptions I had made while developing the NTHCM may have gotten in the way of its ability to relate to maker practice or to fulfill the promise of democratization. Contributions include insights about the merits of the NTHCM as a reflective lens for maker leaders and HCI researchers, insights about the merits of feminist utopianism to guide maker leaders and HCI researchers towards the promise of democratization, and insights about underlying assumptions of HCI endeavors that may be in the way of fulfilling the promise of democratization."
"A Dynamic Approach to Optimizing Interventions and Mitigating Contagion Impacts in Financial Networks","Farthing, Christopher",2021,"While modern financial networks are so large, complex, and dynamic that the interactions between their members are impossible to model in their entirety, mathematical models with some simplifying assumptions allow for effective study of network dynamics that can inform academics, economists, and policymakers. We review prior research and mathematical models examining the clearing of liabilities within financial networks, the network dynamics that affect members’ abilities to clear, and the role of financial contagion in propagating defaults across a network. Implementing the Banks as Tanks model introduced by Sonin and Sonin (2017, 2020) as a coding solution to derive a network’s clearing payment vector as defined by Eisenberg and Noe (2001), we develop an R program that can be used to explore clearing outcomes for the network’s members based on initial information about each’s cash and debt positions and support further analyses. Extending dynamics observed in the Banks as Tanks model and others, we also extend these models’ analysis of outcomes to examine the factors impacting the effectiveness of attempts to rescue defaulting members through provision of outside funding and investment. Our primary contribution is development of a framework to identify optimal interventions a regulator may impose to prevent defaults caused by a bank’s own illiquidity or by financial contagion from other defaulting banks. Secondary contributions include our evaluation of the impact of network structure on intervention cost through simulations and our evaluation of methods for simplification of ergodic network or sub-network structures. Our analysis also provides a framework for further analysis of interventions within more complex networks."
"A Legal Analysis of the Effects of Morse V. Frederick on Student Speech in K-12 Education","Moree, Joseph",2021,"The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of Morse v. Frederick on student speech in K-12 public schools. Cases meeting the research criteria were selected from federal court districts. Those cases were briefed and analyzed. The results of the research were used to develop findings that were placed into four categories: (1) the concurring opinion’s support for school safety, (2) political and social commentary, (3) harassment of school officials, and (4) speech concerning possession, distribution, and use of illegal drugs while at school. The findings led to the development of recommendations for school officials to consider regarding student speech and the development of a Four-Prong Speech Progression Test."
"A Multiple Case Study on the Lived Experiences of Five Upper Elementary School Teachers Who Transitioned from Traditional Grading Practices to Standards-Based Grading Practices","Frazier, Meghan",2021,"Through a qualitative multiple case study, the researcher’s goal in conducting this study was to investigate and understand the experiences of five upper elementary teachers in grades three through five who transitioned from traditional grading practices to standards-based grading (SBG) practices at one elementary school. Using Albert Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) as a framework, this study examined how the five teachers experienced the initial training and subsequent implementation in their transition from traditional grading practices to standards-based grading practices. The researcher also aimed to understand teacher self-efficacy toward the new grading practice based on the training received at the onset of the implementation. A recruitment survey was sent to 79 certified teachers at the study site, chosen based on its convenience and recent implementation of SBG, and yielded the minimum of five participants meeting the criteria to participate in the study. Two of the total five study participants were part of a pilot study conducted in the fall of 2019. The researcher conducted semi-structured face-to-face interviews using an interview protocol established in the pilot study. In order to identify underlying themes present in the five interviews, the researcher used a constant comparison method of analysis (Leech & Onwuegbuzie, 2007). Common themes present in the five case studies include grades as communication, frustration with SBG transition, support from colleagues as useful or not useful, and lack of preparation at the pre-service level. Findings from this study align with the current body of knowledge on the inequities present in the use of traditional grading, the lack of specific grading instruction in teacher preparation programs as well as continued support at the district or school level, and the positives of SBG moving teachers toward best practices. Findings from this study also support teachers’ self-efficacy being tied to the quality of training they receive when making a change in practice."
"A Phenomenological Content Analysis of Siblings' Lived Experiences Related to Having a Sibling with Substance Use Problems","Aucoin, Rose",2021,"ABSTRACTROSE M. AUCOIN. A Phenomenological Research Study of Peoples' Lived Experiences Related to Having a Sibling with Substance Use Problems. (Under the direction of DR. TARYNE M. MINGO) Research indicates that substance use of a family member can affect all members of the family (Church et al., 2018; Kelly et al., 2017; McDonagh et al., 2019). However, the major focus of research to date has been limited to the effects of substance use on the individual who presents with a substance use problem, their parents, their partners, and their children (Selbekk et al., 2018; Shumway et al., 2019). Leaving a gap in the literature related to sibling experiences with a siblings’ substance use. By broadening our view of who needs support when a family presents with an offspring suffering from substance misuse, researchers would help to support the thousands of siblings who are trying to manage their own lives while faced with the demands of their sibling’s addiction (Olafsdottir et al., 2020; Tsamparli & Frrokaj, 2016; Smith-Genthôs et al., 2017). The primary investigator used a phenomenological research design to explore the experiences of 15 participants who identify as having or having had a sibling with substance use problems. Semi-structured interviews and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis were used to investigate the lived experiences of the participants related to having a sibling with substance use problems. The six themes identified were Safety, Chaos, Relationship Stress, Emotionality, Avoidance, and Movement. A review of implications and recommendations for clinicians and future research is included."
"A Pilot Study of Gastro-Intestinal Parasites in Two U.S. Captive Free-Ranging Lemur Populations","Corbett II, Philip",2021,"A comparative gastrointestinal parasite study was conducted looking at different lemur species and their parasite prevalence and diversity at two Association of Zoo & Aquarium accredited facilities, the Duke Lemur Center and Lemur Conservation Foundation. The study compared parasite prevalence and diversity among three different host lemur species, Lemur catta, Eulemur mongoz, and Varecia rubra. A total of 54 fecal samples were collected noninvasively from the lemurs. These samples were prepared for microscopic analysis using a standard fecal flotation method (RUSVM 2020). A total of six different parasite taxa were identified during microscopic analysis. Although no statistical significance (defined as p > 0.05) was found, there are indications that location and diet possibly play a role in differences of parasite prevalence and diversity among the different lemur species that could not be detected with the small sample size. A total of eight parasite-positive samples were found: 5 in L. catta, 2 in E. mongoz, and 1 in V. rubra. Few published studies have conducted comparative parasitology between lemur species; this is especially the case for captive lemurs. Parasitology studies are important due to the relationship between primate parasitology, primate health, and conservation. As such, this study fills a problematic gap in the literature and will hopefully evoke parasitology centered conversations between the Duke Lemur Center and Lemur Conservation Foundation."
"A TARGETED APPROACH TO PROVIDE WEATHER GUIDANCE FOR GENERAL AVIATION PILOTS BASED ON ESTIMATED TIME OF DEPARTURE AND PERSONAL WEATHER MINIMUMS","Dennstaedt, Scott",2021,"Over the last two decades, general aviation pilots in the United States, especially those who fly light fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, have portrayed high rates of vulnerability to weather-related accidents. This high vulnerability rate is in stark contrast to the increased availability of weather reports and forecasts, which has vastly improved given the wide variety of weather guidance now available online and in the cockpit. More specifically, VFR (Visual Flight Rules) into IMC (instrument meteorological conditions) flights is the leading cause of fatal weather-related accidents. A common contributor to these fatal accidents is the pilot’s inability to definitively assess the hazard prior to departure from the relevant weather guidance available. Therefore, it is hypothesized in this research that the lack of sufficient weather reports and forecasts are not a core dilemma, but instead the primary contributing factor is an inaccurate or incomplete weather assessment by pilots before a flight.In this light, it has become apparent that pilots need a well-integrated route-based application that simplifies and organizes weather guidance in a way that requires less technical interpretation, quantifies the risk and gives time-based options to minimize a pilot’s exposure to adverse weather. Consequently, this presents the opportunity for a targeted software application that will eliminate or significantly reduce weather-related accidents especially for pilots planning VFR flights.This research therefore developed a clear assessment of weather-related accidents through a review of the literature and a questionnaire-based survey given to a group of general aviation pilots who fly light fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters in the United States. From these responses, a standard set of personal weather minimum categories was developed based on key adverse weather conditions to evaluate weather-related risks. This included the creation of twelve personal minimum categories that encapsulate the ceiling height, surface visibility and surface wind as well as the risk of airframe icing, turbulence and convective potential that are evaluated for the departure and destination airports and along the route of flight as applicable.The product of this research created an automated online decision-making tool that downloads and stores the latest weather forecasts for key aviation weather variables that contribute to accidents. The application accepts and stores the pilot’s personal weather minimums and evaluates these against the weather along the pilot’s proposed route of flight. The results are depicted graphically in an intuitive way to quantify the overall personal exposure to adverse weather. This is encapsulated in a departure advisor that depicts the personal risk relative to the time of departure over the next 2-3-day period. Moreover, an interactive map and vertical profile was created to allow the pilot to visualize in time and space these weather threats of IMC, wind, airframe icing and turbulence along the pilot’s route. With this time-based approach and intuitive visualizations, such a tool if used prior to a flight will allow GA pilots to choose the optimal time to depart and limit most accidents due to encounters with adverse weather, especially those related to VFR into IMC."
"A Window into My Mirror: An Autoethnography of Culturally Sustaining Pedagogy with LGBTQ+ Students","Kincaid, Nicki",2021,"This research portrays a personal journey of a middle school language arts teacher working with LGBTQ+ students. Using autoethnography as the method, this study interprets personal narratives about the researcher’s adolescent identity development in connection with current culturally relevant teaching practices, specifically for LGBTQ+ students. As the subject of my own study, I focused on the relationships and cultural immersion experiences of my personal identity development. This qualitative research method invites the reader to gain insight into the subculture of this study through the experiences of the author. Perspective, being a root of the study, is unique to the author as well as the reader. Through this autoethnography, the reader is able to gain insight into the formation of a classroom teacher’s identity that shape attitudes and practices within the classroom. This study represents the seeds planted to grow the tree that fosters a culturally sustained classroom."
"A novel machine learning framework for comparison of viral COVID-19–related Sina Weibo and Twitter posts : workflow development and content analysis","Chen, Shi; Zhou, Lina; Song, Yunya; Xu, Qian; Wang, Ping; Wang, Kanlun; Ge, Yaorong; Janies, Daniel",2021,"Background: Social media plays a critical role in health communications, especially during global health emergencies such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a lack of a universal analytical framework to extract, quantify, and compare content features in public discourse of emerging health issues on different social media platforms across a broad sociocultural spectrum. Objective: We aimed to develop a novel and universal content feature extraction and analytical framework and contrast how content features differ with sociocultural background in discussions of the emerging COVID-19 global health crisis on major social media platforms. Methods: We sampled the 1000 most shared viral Twitter and Sina Weibo posts regarding COVID-19, developed a comprehensive coding scheme to identify 77 potential features across six major categories (eg, clinical and epidemiological, countermeasures, politics and policy, responses), quantified feature values (0 or 1, indicating whether or not the content feature is mentioned in the post) in each viral post across social media platforms, and performed subsequent comparative analyses. Machine learning dimension reduction and clustering analysis were then applied to harness the power of social media data and provide more unbiased characterization of web-based health communications. Results: There were substantially different distributions, prevalence, and associations of content features in public discourse about the COVID-19 pandemic on the two social media platforms. Weibo users were more likely to focus on the disease itself and health aspects, while Twitter users engaged more about policy, politics, and other societal issues. Conclusions: We extracted a rich set of content features from social media data to accurately characterize public discourse related to COVID-19 in different sociocultural backgrounds. In addition, this universal framework can be adopted to analyze social media discussions of other emerging health issues beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","COVID-19 (Disease); Twitter (Firm); Social media; Machine learning"

"APE2 is a Critical Regulator of the DNA Damage Response to Maintain Genome Integrity in Mammalian Cells","HOSSAIN, MD AKRAM",2021,"The maintenance of genome integrity and fidelity is essential for the proper function and survival of all organisms. Recent studies have revealed that APE2 is required for the activation of an ATR-Chk1 DNA damage response (DDR) pathway in response to oxidative stress and a defined DNA single-strand break (SSB) in Xenopus laevis egg extracts. However, it remains unclear whether APE2 is a general regulator of DDR pathway and what the biological significance of APE2 is in mammalian cells. Here, I provide evidence using mammalian cultured cell lines including human pancreatic cancer cells that APE2 is important for ATR DDR pathway activation in response to different stressful conditions including oxidative stress, DNA replication stress, and DNA double-strand breaks. Fluorescence microscopy analysis shows that APE2-knock-down (KD) leads to enhanced γH2AX foci and increased micronuclei formation. In addition, a small molecule compound is identified as APE2 inhibitor that specifically compromises the binding of APE2 to ssDNA, its 3′-5′ exonuclease activity, and the defined SSB-induced ATR Chk1 DDR pathway in Xenopus egg extracts. Notably, cell viability assays demonstrate that APE2-KD or APE2 inhibitor sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs. Overall, APE2 is proposed as a general regulator for DDR pathway in genome integrity maintenance in mammalian cells.",
"Abusive Supervision and Subordinate Characteristics: A Relative Importance Analysis","Durham, Brooks",2021,"Abusive supervision is defined as the sustained display of hostile verbal and nonverbal behaviors, excluding physical contact by a supervisor or leader. Abusive supervision is pervasive in the workplace and has many pernicious consequences, ranging from job dissatisfaction to supervisor-related aggression, to home-life disturbances. These problems are costly to organizations, particularly in the form of lost time, lack of productivity, and turnover. Research to date suggests that perceptions of abusive supervision may be driven as much by, if not more than, subordinate characteristics rather than supervisor behavior. The fundamental issue is that although abusive supervision is defined in terms of supervisor behavior, it is assessed via subordinate perceptions of supervisor behavior. While many studies have concentrated on the impact of specific subordinate characteristics on perceptions of abusive supervision, researchers have tended to focus on specific characteristics in isolation. Thus, the literature would benefit from a more comprehensive treatment that examines the collective effect of multiple subordinate characteristics as well as their relative importance with respect to ratings of abusive supervision. This survey-based study focused on demographics, personality, core self-evaluation, and the WUSI scale developed by Harvey, Butler, and Brees (2016). The results were analyzed using regression analysis and supplemented by dominance weights analysis. I found that, collectively, subordinate characteristics accounted for 47% of the variance in subordinate perceptions of abusive supervision and that the WUSI scale clearly dominated, representing 59% of this effect size.",
"Aerodynamics of UAV Ground Effect Interactions","Timms, William",2021,"With the advent of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) becoming more prevalent for military and commercial applications, gaining a better understanding of their aerodynamic characteristics is critical. No matter the application, each operation begins and ends with vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL). Therefore, investigating the aerodynamic effects of ground proximity on thrust, wake, and vehicle stability is required to ensure safe operation. Based on previous use in published experimental studies, 0.240 m diameter rotor models with a rotation rate of 4860 RPM were used in the present work. A finite volume commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code STAR-CCM+ by Siemens was used to run three-dimensional implicit Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations of a Da-Jiang Innovations (DJI) Phantom UAV utilizing dynamic meshing techniques for rotor motion and VTOL scenarios. Model validation was achieved by first simulating single and dual rotor cases to compare predictions of thrust and rotor-rotor interactions to published data. Following this, a full UAV was modeled in a hovering scenario far from solid boundaries to provide a baseline case. The single rotor simulation showed a 5.625% overshoot in thrust compared to an expected value of 3 N, and a 1.473% overshoot compared to a comparable published RANS simulation. At a minimum tip separation distance of 0.05D, a drop in time-averaged thrust of 1.256% and 1.186% was found for the dual rotor and baseline UAV cases compared to an expected drop of ~2%. Upon successfully validating the CFD simulation framework, the baseline UAV simulation was repeated for seven scenarios, having the UAV hover at heights between 3.0 m and ground level with a step change of 0.5 m. These simulations were used to compare how ground effect can change thrust and alter the wake formation. It was determined that ground effect was negligible beyond a height of 1.5 m for this UAV. Thus, the hovering cases beyond 1.5 m were omitted. Finally, a dynamic scenario was simulated having the UAV land from a height of 3.0 m, which was used to assess the stability of the UAV in VTOL by monitoring the pitching moment. Future work will be able to build from these simulations to create reduced order models and investigate more complex scenarios such as UAV ground vehicle wake interactions.",
"African American Males' Perceptions on Teacher Responsiveness to Cultural Diversity","Reddig, Kim",2021,"The overrepresentation of African American males at risk for academic challenges and special education services, disciplinary actions, dropout rates, and incarceration is an alarming trend in the United States that has been ongoing for over 40 years. Research has shown a correlation exists between a teachers’ cultural competence and a students’ positive academic and behavioral outcomes (Boutte & Hill, 2006; Howard & Terry, 2011; Rychly & Graves, 2012). However, many teachers are inadequately prepared with appropriate content knowledge, experience with culturally relevant practices, and training to address culturally and linguistically diverse students’ learning needs (Sobel et al., 2011). A cultural learning gap between teachers and students, along with, inadequate preparation can limit the choice of effective culturally responsive practices. An educator’s beliefs, attitudes, and expectations can have a major impact on student outcomes. (Ladson-Billings, 2006). Culturally responsive teachers place culture at the center of their teaching philosophy and continuously investigate opportunities to factor culture into all aspects of their teaching to improve the performance of diverse students and close the achievement gap (Bonner et al., 2018). The aim of this study was to understand the perceptions of high school African American males receiving special education services or at risk for academic challenges on teacher responsiveness to cultural diversity. This study used a phenomenological qualitative method to gain insight into the lived experiences of African American males. Limitations, implications for practices and suggestions for future research are discussed.",
"An Optimization Study of a Customized Kinetic Façade System Using Regression Model","IM, OKKYUN",2021,"There has been a considerable interest in the development and installation of the building facade system using a dynamic motion which is called a kinetic facade system. Since the kinetic facade system can respond to the change of the external weather conditions, this can play a key role in saving building energy consumption and satisfying occupant’s thermal and visual comforts. Although the building application of the kinetic facade systems continues to increase because of its benefits, the features of the kinetic system cause relatively high installation costs compared to a conventional fixed facade system. Therefore, evaluating a performance of the kinetic facade system in the early design stages is becoming more important. However, the current process for evaluating the performance using a simulation tool is complicated and time-consuming process because the dynamic motion of the kinetic system. It takes a significant amount of time due to the repetitive simulation process associated with complex geometry and dynamic movements. Therefore, most studies on kinetic performance have limitations in grasping the range of time related to performance and specificity of kinetic movement. Thus, this research suggested a prediction methodology using a regression model for a customized kinetic façade system. The regression model allowed user to compare the performance of the kinetic facade system without a simulation process. Also, it can be used to predict an optimal angle of a kinetic motion at a specific point in time.",
"And the Categories Are: Sexual “Realness”, Individualism, and the Paradox of Categories in Ball Culture","Grey, Gabrielle",2021,"Ball culture has been a Black/Latinx gay subculture overlooked by historians. Ball culture served as a safe space for young gay Black/Latinx men and trans-people to express themselves. The competition categories held an equally significant role in ball culture as the balls did. If not for the categories, the balls would not bring the moment where participants present their individualism amongst their peers. Although other social sciences such as gender studies and sexuality studies have explored ball culture, the focus was not on the categories. The categories became an afterthought and were compared to beauty pageants. Ball culture categories were much more than simple competition categories. Many categories had the purpose to teach ""realness"" and challenged homophobia and transphobia, racism, and poverty ball culture participants experienced outside the balls. This thesis specifically examines ball culture competition categories during its golden age, 1981-1993. A discussion on homo/transphobia, racism, and poverty in New York City during ball culture’s golden age lays out the groundwork on why specific categories were created and sustained themselves over time. Ball culture competition categories were separated into two themes: queerness/realness categories and race-based categories. This thesis seeks to establish why ball culture competition categories were created, evolved, and maintained as important mechanisms for Black and Latinx gay men to define themselves and their identities as individuals with self-worth.",
"Anomaly Detection for Manufacturing Applications Using Convolutional Autoencoders","Zouar, Nourelislam",2021,"ABSTRACTNOURELISLAM ZOUAR. ANOMALY DETECTION FOR MANUFACTURING APPLICATIONS USING CONVOLUTIONAL AUTOENCODERS. (Under the direction of DR. MIN SHIN) Anomaly Detection in manufacturing environments is increasingly gaining popularity among companies and researchers. Computer based visual inspection systems are at the core of this interest. In the last few years, computer vision has made immense advancement thanks to deep learning. More specifically, unsupervised learning has proven its strength in this area, mainly due to its ability to deal with all kinds of anomalies and this is due to the philosophy used in this type of machine learning. This research work was motivated by the availability of what is arguably the most comprehensive public anomaly detection dataset, the MVTec dataset [1]. We implemented a pipeline that starts by preprocessing different categories of the MVTec dataset and ends by calculating the prediction accuracies and the inference times. This pipeline includes a convolutional autoencoder. We started by implementing a CAE that follows the description provided by [1]. Then, we have run many experiments using different CAE architectures found in recently published papers. In order to evaluate the performance of all the experimented CAEs, we used a brute force logic to find the best threshold. We used several portions of the calculated accuracies to find the best threshold. These portions were made using different percentages of the calculated accuracies, ranging from 70% to 100%.",
"Application of Local Transmission Line Modelled Metasurfaces and Comparison to Huygens-Fresnel Principle Modelled Metasurfaces","Trusnovic, Matthew",2021,"Metasurfaces have many applications, from beam steering effects to polarization control. There are two main theories that are used in the creation of modern metasurfaces, one based on the Huygens-Fresnel Principle and one based on Local Transmission Line models of the metasurface. The Local Transmission Line model is the more commonly used theory, but comparing structures constructed using this method to metasurfaces created using the Huygens-Fresnel principle will show the advantages and disadvantages to each design theory.The Huygens-Fresnel Principle modeled metasurfaces operate on the principle of a duel dipole radiation which is powered by an incident wave. The duel dipoles, electric and magnetic, radiate energy forward and backward from the surface which constructively and destructively interfere with one another. This interference creates the output wavefront as well as backward propagating waves. The metasurface is constructed of various unit cells which contain electric and magnetic dipoles, which are matched to the required transmission coefficient phase and magnitude. If this matching is not perfect, then significant backward radiation can occur and cause errors. Despite this, the output wavefront can be steering in extreme steering angles and with unique behaviour if done correctly.The Local Transmission Line modelled surfaces operate with generalized Snell's Law at its core, which allows the metasurface to guide and transform the incident wave. The metasurface is modelled as a series of admittance blocks on a transmission line, with length of transmission line that correspond to dielectric layers between the admittance layers. The metasurface is also designed to operate multiple input modes simultaneously, allowing for the steering of TE and TM waves at different angles using the same structure. This application is impossible for Huygens-Fresnel modelled surfaces as that theory requires different surface configurations for each operating mode, requiring the dipoles to be oriented normally to the input electric field. However, the Local Transmission Line modeled surfaces decrease in overall length as the desired steering angle increases, which decreases the accuracy of the surface for larger steering angles.Overall, Local Transmission Line modeled metasurfaces have far more application and versatility when compared to metasurfaces designed using the Huygens-Fresnel principle. Although extreme steering angles and unique wave behaviour can be designed using the Huygens-Fresnel principle, the disadvantages in designing such a surface and the errors caused by improper matching of unit cells make this method less versatile. The Local Transmission Line theory requires a less rigorous design process for creating unit cells, and there is room for some error in the admittances that do not compromise the basic functionality of the structure. This theory also lends itself to easier design, as these surfaces can be created directly on dielectrics using current PCB technology.",
"Approaches for Power Grid Management and Ancillary Services with DC-AC Micro-grids Comprising of PV Farm and Hybrid Energy Storage System","Joshi, Aniket",2021,"The emergence of the concept of DC grids comes from the fact that there is an increasing number of power grid components that naturally operate with DC power. The combined trend of DC sources and loads in power grids is an important player in the sudden growth of research interest in DC micro-grids and their interplay with the main power grid. Even though DC grids are easy to implement on a small scale and their own, the connection of the DC micro-grid with the AC power grid takes research problems to another level. Innovative approaches, methods, distribution system architectures, and control strategies are required to manage and mitigate the problems of involving DC micro-grid in conjunction with conventional power grids. Through this research work, novel, innovative and comprehensive system architectures and control strategies are proposed to mitigate some of the problems of DC micro-grid like DC-AC micro-grid interplay during steady-state and dynamic conditions, tandem operation of DC, and AC micro-grids for frequency regulation. The dissertation also proposes the concept of a DC ring architecture to emulate a small residential community using a common DC-bus-centric structure. The research work aims to provide a comprehensive DC-AC micro-grid design and control architecture that can provide a platform for testing and validation of steady-state and fault time system performance. The proposed methods in each chapter have been incorporated and validated on standard distribution test systems provided by IEEE like the 13 bus and123 bus systems and hence their analysis is crucial and could serve as a reference for future design and control of DC micro-grids. In this work, first, a new approach for improving grid inertia based on a Photo-Voltaic (PV) farm in conjunction with a fully active Hybrid Energy Storage System(HESS) comprising of battery and ultra-capacitor is proposed. The approach captures grid dynamics using the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) angle measurements (δ) at the inverter terminal. The proposed approach in this dissertation demonstrates an overall improvement in the inertial response of the system by up to 25% compared to the conventional frequency-droop approach. It also records a faster settling time than the frequency-droop approach by up to 47 seconds. The approach has been tested using an error minimization-based Proportional-Integral (PI) control and an error minimization-based Optimal Control (LQR) for frequency regulation. This method utilizes the rate of change of PCC angle (dδdt) which is observed to vary based on the proximity of PCC to the grid dynamic location. It has been observed that the proposed architecture controls the Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) and primary and secondary frequency response without the need for frequency-droop information of the system, thereby ensuring grid stability that utilizes renewable energy-based resources. The second contribution is a novel voltage angle minimization-based approach for grid inertia improvement which further updates and validates the proposed test system and primary control that was used for the previous approach discussed above. The proposed method successfully quantifies and differentiates grid dynam-ics from steady-state conditions by measuring the deviation of voltage angles at the DER interconnection bus (∆δ). A Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller with a quality function is formulated to minimize (∆δ) during the event of grid dynamics for frequency regulation of the distribution system by optimal dispatch of HESS. The proposed LQR architecture is observed to perform better for inertial support when compared with the conventional frequency-droop approach. Third, a novel architecture that dynamically updates LQR penalty gains based on a combination of recursion and energy storage ramp-rate function is proposed. This helps control the HESS devices separately and not based on their size. The proposed approach is considered as an improvement on the static gain LQR with the added attribute of being robust to uncertainty in the control input. Finally, a concept of DC Ring where 4 DERs are connected to emulate the electrical network of a small residential community is introduced. An Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) identification is used to completely identify the dynamic state-space of 4 DERs along with AC-interfacing two 3-phase d−q inverters. This approach is used to generate globally optimized LQR control actions for each of the 4 DERs based on individual weighting factors provided by ADMM. These weighting factors are deduced by drawing a consensus among each output to control the input transfer function. The approach generates globally coordinated control set-points for all DERs that can detect the change in (∆δ) corresponding to the fault event.",
"Assessment of Burnout With Implementation of a Brief Mindfulness Intervention in Palliative Care Clinicians","Snyder, Rachel",2021,"Background: While work in palliative and hospice care can be a rewarding experience in helping those suffering with complicated and terminal illnesses, it can also expose those involved to significant work stress, potentially leading to burnout. Palliative medicine is a medical specialty wherein clinicians provide care for the medical, psychosocial and spiritual needs of seriously ill patients, and facilitate their understanding and coping skills through the illness progression. These clinicians are especially vulnerable to frequent exposure to traumatic situations due to the high density of complicated patients under their care, placing them at risk for burnout. Objective: The objective of this quality improvement project was to better understand burnout levels in palliative nurse practitioners and nurses in a large inpatient, academic hospital system and to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing mindfulness meditation to reduce burnout levels. Design: The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was used to assess burnout pre and post implementation of a brief, self-guided mindfulness intervention via smartphone application. The intervention was performed individually, remotely, and asynchronously with volunteers. Setting/participants: A total of 12 palliative care nurse practitioners and nurses volunteered from an inpatient palliative care group within a large healthcare system in North Carolina. Results: MBI domains analysis revealed a statistically significant decrease in emotional exhaustion (Pre: 2.2; Post: 1.5; p=.016). The depersonalization domain (emotional disconnect) score did not show a statistically significant decrease in the post-intervention score, but a numerical decrease was reported (Pre: 0.82; Post: 0.65). The personal accomplishment domain score did not show any significant change (Pre: 4.6; Post: 4.5). The reflective questions indicated that many participants felt the mindfulness exercise was feasible, tended to feel calmer, were more relaxed, and were satisfied with the intervention. This correlates to the statistically significant result on the emotional exhaustion subscale, leading to the conclusion that the mindfulness intervention was valuable to those who participated and had efficacious results. Conclusion: The information gained from this project is vital to better understanding burnout in palliative clinicians given its consequences are detrimental to healthcare systems, patient care and clinicians themselves. By developing evidence-based interventions and training, burnout could be prevented, thereby promoting longevity and satisfaction of clinicians in palliative care. If burnout can be eased, seasoned clinicians can be retained, leading to reduced financial burden on the healthcare system and improved patient care and satisfaction.",
"Autonomous Vehicle Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance Along a Predetermined Vector","Pfeifer, Elijah",2021,"Search and Rescue (SaR) operations rely on civilian volunteers to provide mandatory manpower when covering large areas of land. These SaR operations are typically conducted in remote environments where conditions can be hazardous and GPS signal intermittent. This project designed and tested an autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) capable of sequentially navigating along a series of GPS waypoints in an effort to minimize harm to operators and bolster the ranks of SaR crews. An embedded controller was used to calculate vector trajectory for navigation and pathing corrections from data provided by an onboard GPS unit and compass. Scans from a 2D-LIDAR were processed and analyzed by an onboard computer before passing network-published shared variables to the embedded controller for obstacle detection and avoidance systems. A linear model dictated a predictive algorithm for navigating the GPS waypoints while GPS signal was unavailable. For testing, the UGV autonomously navigated within range of each waypoint before advancing to the next until all waypoints were met. For testing with intermittent GPS, the UGV autonomously navigated the same waypoints, but an additional system added randomly generated periods where the GPS was masked from the UGV's primary navigation system. This study results in a highly successful system of autonomous vehicle navigation and obstacle avoidance using vector trajectory but a limited system of navigating without GPS. An outline for future research in further improving the tested system is discussed.",
"Aviatar- An Augmented Reality System to Improve Pilot Performance for Unmanned Aerial Systems","Abbott, Robert",2021,"In the modern airspace, small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) such as drones are becoming increasingly popular with both amateur enthusiasts as well as professional pilots. In the three years following the initiation of the small drone registration rule in 2015, over one million drones were registered in the U.S. alone. By 2022, the United States Federal Aviation Administration estimates that the number of registrations could exceed 3.8 million UAS. In recognition of the necessity to integrate sUAS traffic into the national airspace system, Congress passed the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, which created the mandate for the FAA to regulate sUAS operation in United States national airspace (NAS). This also created a number of obligations for drone pilots, including avoidance of restricted airspace, maximum flight levels, safe separation from aircraft - including other UAS - as well as avoiding flight over civilian human population and contact with personal property such as buildings or cars. These new obligations associated with safety coupled with the goals of recreational or commercial flight act to degrade pilot situational awareness. Because of the nature of flying a drone either for pleasure or commercial purpose, it is very easy for operators to lose their situational awareness (SA) of the environment around them. A study published by the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) in 2017 found that the majority of commercial aviation accidents not attributable to aircraft systems failure involved the crew’s loss of SA of the aircraft or the environment, and that crew distraction from operation was associated with all of these accidents. If this is the case with commercial aircraft pilots inside of an enclosed aircraft cockpit in relative isolation, it is easy to imagine that the potential for distraction in the UAS environment is at least great. This demonstrates the potential for a decreased SA state to create an unsafe environment for other pilots and bystanders and lead to fines and penalties for the drone pilot if damage, injury, or disruption to the airspace occurs. While many times a pilot or flight crew can be distracted by agents not directly associated with the operation of an aircraft, there are many flight phenomena that can require a pilot’s focus to manage. This focused attention can also degrade a pilot’s SA. One mode of pathological flight phenomena in fixed-wing aircraft is that of pilot-induced oscillation (PIO). These PIO can occur either as a result of pilot-airframe coupling as in the case of biodynamic feedthrough, or as a result of the lag between pilot observation and action and the propagation of the pilot’s actions and the control response of the aircraft under the influence of structural or environmental stimulus on the aircraft system. Under either scenario, the actions necessary to identify and resolve of these PIO can quickly distract the pilot and cause a degradation of pilot SA level. This pilot distraction can lead to mission task element (MTE) failure, loss of aircraft control, and damage or destruction of the aircraft and surrounding persons and property. In this study, we make an effort to identify the state of the art in pilot situational awareness research and to understand the critical pilot-aircraft interactions that are at the forefront of research in this field. Pilot induced oscillations, especially of the Type III nonlinear family, are one such topic that researchers have worked on heavily for over 40 years and have made minimal progress in solving. In fact, the addition of autonomous control functions to modern avionics systems, such as control surface rate limiting features, have increased the severity associated with these Type III PIO when they occur. To broaden the context of our work, similar issues are faced in a variety of other vehicle control situations including ships, cars, farm equipment, and large trucks.To support our goal of improving the experience, productivity, and safety of remote UAS pilots, we implemented a see-through augmented reality headset system, AviatAR, to provide information to the pilot with minimal detrimental effects. We also created a method, the Flight-Space Volume Model (FSVM), to enable accurate placement of an augmented reality cue that we refer to as a Gizmo in the pilot’s visual field. This cue serves to aid in pilot accuracy and notification of predicted pilot-induced oscillations to enable a pilot to actively react this phenomena in the early stages of formation. During our research, one issue that we noticed was a dearth of research on pilot SA and PIO phenomena associated with multirotor UAS systems. Because of the increase in the number of UAS systems available for both personal and commercial use, we felt that there were many contributions that could be made to this several fields of study. Thus, our research is a multidisciplinary work that supports three fields of research: computer science, cognitive science, and aeronautics. In our experiments, we evaluated the performance of a pilot flying a low-autonomy unaugmented quadcopter in an outdoor, uncontrolled setting for both an unaided pilot as well as one equipped with three different evolutions of the AviatAR head-mounted display. In each of these evolutions, we included both the Gizmo component alone as well as two variations of the PIO cue, both in the superior and inferior peripheral visual fields, and evaluated pilot performance in terms of positional accuracy. Our analysis demonstrates that a pilot equipped with the AviatAR display outperformed the unaided pilot, and that the addition of the PIO cue further enhanced pilot performance with respect to accuracy. Further, we demonstrated that placing a persistent low-complexity informational cue in the inferior peripheral visual field of the pilot significantly improved pilot accuracy over the superior field cue, which leads to future work to better understand how low-complexity inferior peripheral field cues can be used to enhance the performance and improve situational awareness of equipment operators in a broad range of applications.",
"Black Doulas and The Quest For Empowerment in the Black Woman's Birthing Experience","Mattison, Sydney",2021,"Doula care has proven to be an effective approach to reducing adverse birthing outcomes among women. However, less is known about doula care and birthing outcomes concerning specifically Black women. This qualitative study focused on the narratives of five Black doulas and examines their experiences in providing care. The purpose of this project was to find out (a) what motivates Black women to become doulas, (b) to fully assess what care from a doula looks like, (c) what makes that care unique, and (d) to determine if there has been an increase in demand for Black doulas, and if so, why. This project, conducted for submission to the Doulas of North America International (DONA), examines how Black doula care can be beneficial in birthing outcomes for Black women.",
"Black Lives Matter and Black Power","Fraser, Daviana",2021,"Today, Black Americans face the same foes as in previous efforts to secure civil rights. Over the last decade, names like Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice, Keith Lamont Scott, Philando Castile, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor join those of Emmett Till, Rodney King and countless others as causalities of white supremacy. This recurrence has ignited and unified a generation of activists through the phrase ""Black Lives Matter."" The Black Lives Matter movement, like the Black Power movement, has named Blackness as a nexus for racial equity. For both movements, the specification of Blackness responded to a need to differentiate the experiences of Black people under racial oppression from others and binds members of this oppressed community to one another. In juxtaposition, both movements also trace the progression of Black centered social justice efforts led by and for members of the Black community who identify with the use of justified anger against injustice. These movements serve as critiques of the mainstream Civil Rights Movement and the ways that its leaders prioritized the feelings and permissions of white people. The objective of this thesis is to conduct a comparative analysis of Black Power and Black Lives Matter in order to better understand the rhetorical strategies of the latter, contemporary movement. Using Malcolm X’s Message to the Grassroots; Stokely Carmichael’s Black Power and We Ain’t Going; Amanda Gorman’s The Hill We Climb; Nikki Giovanni’s Ego Tripping (there may be a reason why); Beyoncé’s Black Parade; and texts from the Black Lives Matter organizational webpage, the comparative analysis will offer an examination of each movement’s approach to respectability politics, Black identity construction, and leadership structure.  ",
"Breaking Down Barriers to Goals of Care Discussions With Terminally Ill Cancer Patients","Poillucci, Victoria",2021,"Opportunities to discuss options for care when faced with a life limiting disease is the right of all patients. Yet, healthcare provider feelings of awkwardness, fear of diminishing hope, and fear of failing to cure can result in missed opportunities to explore what patients really want for end-of-life care. Because these Goals-of-Care Discussions are not occurring, patients often receive unwanted and expensive care. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to evaluate the effect of education on oncology providers’ self-efficacy for Goals-of-Care Discussions, and to explore barriers and opportunities to promote completion of earlier Goals-of-Care Discussions. Two white board scribe videos were created to educate providers and for consideration for future use to show patients as an ice breaker to begin these difficult conversations. The sample included 66 Oncologists, Nurse Practitioners, and Physician Assistants from a large academic cancer center in the southeast United States. A Wilcoxon Signed Rank test showed a statistically significant immediate improvement in the oncology provider’s self-efficacy after viewing the videos (p<.001). Thematic analysis revealed 5 themes: lack of sufficient clinic time, provider comfort level, documentation as key to communication, protocol development, and oncologist versus palliative care (whose job is it?). Education for healthcare providers and tools to help initiate conversations with patients can help improve self-efficacy in conducting Goals-of-Care Discussion. Future research is needed to look at the cost of unwanted care and how developing a comfort level with having discussions surrounding end-of-life can reduce healthcare costs and improve patient centered care.",
"Canvas of a Community: The Visual Rhetoric of Black Liberation in Charlotte, North Carolina","Manning Jr., Mark",2021,"Public art, such as graffiti, street art and murals are powerful vessels of ontological expression that allow nuanced and contextual ideas to be communicated to and about the communities that they exist within. Charlotte (NC) has emerged as a worthy site for analyzing such artifacts, namely, instances of public art that represent the experiences of the Black community. With an emphasis on visual rhetoric, public advocacy, and public memory, this thesis project seeks to better understand the ways that social movement groups, such as the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as localized communities, use visual rhetoric to both highlight the experiences of the Black community, while also helping to form and arrange public memory of historic events in Black history. Through the analysis of the BLM mural on Tryon Street, a mural by artist Abel Jackson titled Brooklyn Memories, as well as an untitled mural by Alex DeLarge, I explore the various ways that these works of public art help to advocate for the social issues and concerns, and intersectional identities of the Black community, while also understanding how these works of art help to form public memory of the past and present communities who live in Charlotte (NC).",
"Changing the Conversation on Passive and Active Job Seekers: A Continuum-Based Approach","Mansfield (Abberger), Claire",2021,"As employers leverage recruitment activities to compete for active job seekers, they may also seize opportunities to recruit those who are not actively searching for jobs (i.e., passive job seekers). The literature currently focuses on active job seekers and has created a false dichotomy between active and passive job seekers. This study aims to change the conversation on passive job seekers and emphasize that all individuals fall on a continuum of job seeking behavior frequency. There is currently a lack of theoretical insight into the cognitive processes involved in the recruitment of active and passive job seekers, and misalignment between theoretically and practically relevant constructs and the measures currently being used. This study aims to identify the factors and mechanisms that attract talent across the job seeking behavior frequency continuum and establish a more thorough understanding of the factors that influence candidates’ actual job choices. The first contribution of this study to the field of recruitment is the reconceptualization of active and passive job seeking as different levels of job seeking behavior frequency on a continuum. The second is the extension of expectancy theory to the recruitment of job seekers across the continuum. The third contribution of this research is that it moves the needle to more closely approximate a measure of actual job choice decisions and provides a better understanding of how candidates make job choice decisions. This research may also inform the tailoring of organizational policies and practices to best attract job seekers on the passive end of the continuum, which could lead to advantageous recruitment outcomes.",
"Characterization of Highly Efficient Delivery Models for Eye Care Services in Veteran Affairs","Kilambi, Sruthi",2021,"Veterans Affairs (VA) provides eye care and vision treatment to all eligible veterans to help improve eye and vision health. Over the past years, timely access to eye care has become a challenge with the increase in its demand. Therefore, it is important to improve the efficiency of the processes by identifying and implementing best practices. The main purpose of this study is to identify critical factors to improve VA’s eye care and vision clinical performance. For this research, VA aggregate data from FY 2017-2019 are collected for Optometry and Ophthalmology Services for multiple medical centers in different regions in the US and analyzed through statistical models including Multiple Linear Regression, Stepwise Regression, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 26 different model variations were compared in an experimental setting to see the robustness and sensitivity of the findings. Multiple Linear Regression showed better performance with R-squared values of 0.294, 0.322 and adjusted R-squared 0.264, 0.292 for Optometry and Ophthalmology, from all the tested models respectively. The results indicate that input factors such as ""Physician Clinical FTEE"", ""Clinical Support Staff per Physician Clinical FTEE"", ""Physician Clinical FTEE per 10KSpecialty Unique"" ""Adj MDFTEE"", ""Highest complexity (complex_1a)"" and ""low complexity (complex_3)"" are the most critical factors for Optometry performance. On the other hand, ""Residents"", ""Physician Clinical FTEE"", ""Physician Clinical FTEE per 10KSpecialty Unique"", ""Clinical Support Staff per Physician Clinical FTEE"" and ""seem to be the most critical factors for Ophthalmology performance.",
"Characterizing the acoustic signature of a quadrotor in hovering flight","Harrison, Jacob",2021,"Quadrotors are small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) that generate sound characterized by a unique acoustic signature. In this research, we aim to determine the acoustic signature of a quadrotor and differentiate it from ambient noise in audio samples. Our hypothesis is that we will be able to distinguish between different quadrotors-microphone relative ranges by analyzing the frequency spectrum around the propeller blade’s rotation rate and its harmonics. The quadrotors were designed with four Cobra CM-4008 multirotor motors connected to 11inch diameter propeller blades. In our experiment, we collected multiple one minute audio recordings of the quadrotor in an outdoor environment on campus. Data was collected at varying distances, in addition to a control recording of the ambient noise. A Dayton Audio UMM-6 microphone and windscreen were mounted to a stand boom for collecting recordings. The collected audio files were analyzed in MATLAB to produce spectrograms in the 10 Hz to 1 kHz band, plotted with a common range of intensities from -150 to -90 dB/Hz. There is evidence of higher sound intensity in the 150 Hz to 250 Hz range in audio recordings with the quadrotor operating. These frequencies correspond approximately to the motor and propeller blade rotation rates. Our preliminary results suggest that detecting the quadrotor is possible at a distance of at least 5 meters. Ongoing work aims to improve the characterization of the signature and determine if relative range can be inferred from the audio signal.",

"Choosing a Regional Resilience Partner: A comparative study of urban, suburban, and rural natural hazard preparedness conditions","Danis, Christina",2021,"Whether urban, suburban, or rural or from different United States (US) geographic regions, communities expect public officials to guide them to better prepare for and adapt to changing conditions and recurring natural hazard threats. Natural hazard preparedness conditions characterize the compilation of resilience and vulnerability conditions and incorporate prior response decisions into state and local natural hazard planning, policies, and practices. Many different options are available to empower vulnerable regions with the right resiliency tools; what is essential to understand is these communities' capacity to influence natural hazard resiliency planning effectiveness. The literature suggests when rural, suburban, and urban communities understand why a resilient region inhibits disaster impacts and supports the restoration of local economic, social, and ecosystem services, there is greater participation in the preparedness process. My research provides context and insight about how regional natural hazard preparedness conditions may bolster community planning and capital across the urban-rural continuum. This study evaluates contiguous US county-level natural hazard resilience and vulnerability with a measurement tool developed at the University of Missouri entitled the Missouri Transect Project (MTP). It reflects a gap in the peer-reviewed research as the MTP has yet to be field-tested. I examine the MTP via a mixed-method approach. My two quantitative analyses, a categorical regression, and a spatial cluster/outlier statistic inform my qualitative interview questions with the 10 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) region Community Preparedness Officers (CPO) about the value of the MTP. I use triangulation to test the degree of external validity of the MTP community preparedness tool. My findings validate the MTP as a community natural hazard preparedness tool to promote urban-rural patterns of resilience and vulnerability. My MTP economic variable model findings indicate counties with increased building insurance risk values have slightly increased preparedness odds than lower building risk counties. The MTP economic and infrastructure resilience spatial cluster/outlier statistic for rural counties found them less prepared than suburban and urban counties. My research serves as a useful heuristic to understand why natural hazards do not just bring damages but provide pre-disaster planning insight and the ability to examine post-disaster aid as a community-building versus property re-building opportunity. The CPO interviews indicate the need to bolster education and outreach for rural areas about FEMA preparedness documents, mobile applications, virtual disaster preparedness videos, disaster simulation board games, and context-sensitive social media outreach measures. My research supports establishing social resilience policies and procedures within FEMA, states, and counties to bolster regional and community resilience by reducing regional vulnerabilities through enhanced education and coordination of state and local hazard mitigation planning mechanisms, particularly for under-resourced rural areas.",
"Christian Sun Worship and Theurgy in Late Antique Rome","Sells, Justin",2021,"In Late Antique Rome the worship of the sun penetrated into Christian belief and practice. This is usually explained in terms of a type of syncretism, where the sun god in Roman religion during this time (often seen as being at the apex of the pantheon) was conflated with the Christian god. These ideas are often drawn from an analysis of texts from the time, particularly those of Roman philosophers and the Christian clergy and theologians. By using the methodology of a people’s history – with a focus on reading between the lines of the works produced by the elites who dominated the literature, as well as with special attention to material artifacts – we can begin to look at what the sun worship meant to the actual Christians, and not simply from the perspective of their critics. This methodology allows us to understand that the Christians who were worshipping the sun in Late Antique Rome were not doing so out of a type of syncretism, but rather that they were participating in the popular form of magic known as theurgy, which included the invocation of certain deities (such as the sun) for the sake of the soul’s ascension after death.",
"Civilizing paternalism: mill, autonomy, and Indian assimilation policies","Lee, Christina",2021,"John Stuart Mill, a Western philosopher of the Enlightenment period, argues that paternalism is an infringement on an individual’s autonomy. Although Mill argues as such, Western powers have been observed to exercise paternalism by way of imperialist policies and practices throughout history. In my thesis, I will argue that there is a paradoxical tension between a Western desire for anti-paternalism domestically alongside a justification for paternalism abroad. I will utilize a literature review to further support my argument. I will present a case study on the Lakota Indians in the Sioux Nation and the policies the United States federal government passed to restrict the cultural autonomy of these peoples. I argue that the federal government infringed on the autonomy of Lakota Indians by forced cultural assimilation and that such assimilation served a purpose to imperialize rather than to guide. I will delve into the implications of whether or not the federal government’s forced cultural assimilation of the Lakota Indians can be justified by Mill’s defense of British imperialism in India. My case study of the Lakota Indians will provide us with a way to view a loss of legal status of Indians from a loss of autonomy and the ramifications that has had on the Indian community. By considering the legal status of the Indian peoples, we are forced to acknowledge our current legal system and the ways in which such a system still acts to prevent Indian tribes from gaining full autonomy.",
"Coaching in Early Intervention: Practitioners' Perceptions of the Training and Implementation Process","Faryadi, Lisa",2021,"Recommended and best practices support the use of coaching strategies in promoting child and family outcomes in Early Intervention (EI) programs. However, practitioners have found it challenging to shift to a coaching approach with families, and there is a gap between knowledge and implementation (Douglas et al., 2019; Peterson et al., 2018). The present study used a non-experimental qualitative design to examine the perceptions of EI practitioners about using a coaching approach. Participants (n = 59) from two EI Facebook coaching support groups were surveyed to gain insight into the barriers they face in adopting a coaching style of interaction with parents, as well as their perspectives on supports they need to be successful. Findings indicated that although practitioners value coaching, they experience challenges in implementing coaching practices and identify needs for ongoing and in-depth professional development. The current study has important implications for how agencies and organizations support practitioners in learning to adopt coaching practices with families.  ",
"Cognitive, affective, and personality predictors of confirmatory political information seeking","Brunswick, Michael",2021,"Confirmation bias is the phenomenon where an individual seeks, navigates, and processes information in ways to reinforce previously held beliefs or attitudes. Contentious political climates exacerbate effects of confirmatory information seeking, with potentially dire divisive consequences. The present two studies bring together current research in political science and psychology to try to predict confirmation bias behaviors. Specifically, the studies assess affective constructs, including mood state, emotion regulation, and need for affect (NfA), as well as personality driven cognitive constructs, including openness to new experiences and need for cognition (NfC) on the seeking of confirmatory or non-confirmatory political information. Data from Study One was collected before and after the 2016 election and examines the impact of openness to experience, emotion regulation, and their interactions on the seeking of confirmatory political information. Study Two data was from a multi-timepoint survey in the first year and a half of President Trump’s term to examine the impact of emotional state, NfA, NfC, and emotion regulation, and their interactions on discussion seeking with those of dissimilar political views. Multiple moderated hierarchical regressions suggest that individuals who use more engagement-oriented emotion regulation strategies (like reappraisal), have high NfC, or high NfA may be less likely to seek information that confirms their political views. These findings suggest that there may be a combinatorial influence of cognitive and affective influencers related to real world information seeking indicative of confirmation bias.",
"Corruption, Inequality, or Growth: Illuminatic Trinity or Nature?","Fowler, Joe",2021,"This paper explores popular economic, political, and social conceptions of the relationshipbetween income inequality and corruption. Contemporary politics have become heavily divided on income inequality. Therefore, using current econometric methods such as panel Granger (non)-causality, dynamic panel models, and cross-lagged maximum likelihood estimation to understand better the underlying data generating process. The significance of this paper is threefold. First, multiple dynamic regressions are used to test the econometric assumptions identifying possible bidirectional causality. Second, the analysis finds that income inequality is not a statistically significant determinant of contemporaneous corruption. However, preceding values of the income share of the top 1% do correlate with future values of corruption in all dynamic models. Last, to test these assumptions against the new institutional hypothesis proposed by North (1990), a Panel Vector Autoregression tests whether specific political environments favor economic growth. The Panel Vector Autoregression results show that variations in per capita GDP can explain 8% of the variation, and 1% income share explains 13% of the variation in corruption perceptions. Further, robustness checks of the dynamic panel models include the use of two different periods. First, by using data from 2000 and 2002 through 2017 and because of the slow movement to change in corruption and inequality, I took the average over three-year periods from 2002 through 2017.",
"Cranial Capacity Variation of Pleistocene Homo and Possible Speciation Events","Hudock, Autumn",2021,"The field of paleoanthropology is tasked with studying the morphology of extinct hominins using fossilized remains. To study the evolution of the human brain, researchers use endocast data derived from fossil skulls, in order to assess when and how our brains have changed throughout time. Endocasts provide the measurement of cranial capacity, a proxy for brain size, and is one investigative avenue to assess human brain evolution. This study gathers fossil endocast data for 156 hominin specimens, as well as other identifying information for each specimen, to gauge how variation of brain size (cranial capacity) has changed throughout our genus. By implementing statistical formulas for rolling window samples, the coefficient of variation (CV) of cranial capacity is calculated across time and species. Rather than assess if cranial capacity has increased throughout time, the current study analyzes variation throughout time, comparing variation throughout the past 2 million years. Comparisons for cranial capacity variation are made with reported values for living apes and modern humans. This analysis is done with the added context of suggested speciation events having occurred in the Pleistocene. This study provides an assessment of variation for this morphological trait across time. The results are interpreted within the context of expected variation represented in living apes and modern humans. Interestingly, cranial capacity variation of Early Pleistocene Homo was the highest recorded in this study, followed by moderate variation of the Middle and Late Pleistocene, with moments of increased variation occurring in both periods. The study also demonstrates, that from about 35 Ka to the onset of the Holocene, cranial capacity variation for archaic human populations matched that recorded for modern human populations. Ultimately, this work demonstrates that the most likely speciation event occurred sometime in the Early Pleistocene, possibly coinciding with the taxonomic designations of Homo georgicus and Homo ergaster.

"Creative Energy: Exploring Jail Arts Programs and Cultural Capital","Miller, Lindsey",2021,"This study explores the beliefs, goals, and motivations of arts-based prison initiatives based on acase study of a jail arts program provided by an art museum in Charlotte, North Carolina. This case study includes in-depth interviews with individuals who provide a range of support for this program, which I compare with interviews conducted with individuals involved in other arts- based programs outside the criminal justice system in Charlotte. I supplement this case study with information garnered from attending Justice Arts Coalition meetings. Analyses focus on the ideas that respondents have about perceived benefits of arts programming, potential for building cultural capital, and the capacity of arts-based programs to assess their impact. Findings have implications for sociological theory and research about cultural capital as well as for arts-based prison programs.",
"DACA Recipients Narratives: Pursuing Noncredit Occupational Training","Gardner, Andrew",2021,"This adapted in-depth qualitative interview study explored and documented the lived experiences of four DACA recipients that pursued noncredit occupational training opportunities at a community college in North Carolina. The purpose was to understand what experiences led DACA recipients to enroll in noncredit occupational education in the community college setting, insight about their educational experiences in higher education, and how they used the education they gained through noncredit occupational education. Participant interviews styled after Seidman (2019) served as the primary means of data collection. Following Seidman (2019) protocols for an adapted in-depth qualitative interview, participants put their life into context, provided detailed accounts of certain critical life experiences, and reconstructed their experience within the framework of the study. Upon completion of all interviews and transcription, a detailed six phase thematic analysis guided by Braun and Clarke (2006) was completed. Though their experiences varied, four major themes were identified during the analysis process. Themes generated spoke to the personal, professional, and social experiences that shaped their journey and aspirations. The findings provided insight about each participant’s desperate path to pursue higher education and how noncredit occupational training provided them a ""hidden"" opportunity. Family played the greatest role in motivating and supporting participants during their journey. A high level of determination and perseverance was displayed. Participants combated obstacle after obstacle to enroll in postsecondary education and successfully leveraged it to embark on their professional career. Three conclusions were reached: (1) policies influence DACA students; (2) DACA students receive a lack of guidance; (3) DACA students leverage credentials.",
"Dancing with Ink","Duemmler, Kristina",2021,"The following creative thesis contains the first 100 pages of the historical fiction novel on the life of Lady Mary Wroth, the first woman in the Early Modern Era to publish a prose poetry novel. The thesis begins and ends in the year 1651. It is here that the text delves into the misgivings in Wroth’s life: losing her estate, her financial struggles, and her reputational conflicts. As the story unveils the truth about what happened in Wroth’s later life, it will show an up close and personal story of Wroth as a child in the year 1602, where the work explores the idea of girlhood in Early Modern England. In between narrative moments with present day Wroth and childhood Wroth is a third narrative structure: young adult Wroth. This section focuses on the years 1604-1606, where she began married life with Robert Wroth. It is my hope in this section to show what an Early Modern marriage looked like from a woman's perspective. The work does not follow a chronological order but instead follows a jump cut structure where times and events are explored and then the narration jumps to another time and another event with no logical connection. The reader learns about three different versions of Wroth at the same time, and each time period informs the story and draws the reader forward in the narrative. Thematic concerns such as feminist theory, womanhood, relationships between people and between people and the outside world, and memory and trauma are explored in the work. The creative thesis will provide a close examination of Lady Mary Wroth’s life, allowing readers to be inside the mind of Wroth during paramount moments in her life, the likes of which has never been done before.",
"Decentralized Agent-Based Control of Distributed Energy Resources for Providing Multiple Services in Active Distribution Networks","Karandeh, Roozbeh",2021,"In recent decades, due to the carbon-free energy policies of power utilities, small and medium-scale renewable energy sources (RES), such as roof-top solar photovoltaic panels (PV), have been widely deployed across the distribution systems.However, due to intermittency and variability in their output, RES are often interfaced with energy storage systems, particularly electrochemical batteries, capable of supplying and absorbing energy in a matter of seconds or a couple of cycles. As controllable, flexible, and fast-response distributed energy resources (DER), battery energy storage systems (BESS) can be used in a wide range of grid and customer applications. However, storage technology is costly and a single application may not recover the costs, while a combination of multiple services might justify the expenses. Particularly, behind-the-meter (BTM) BESS is only used for the owner's energy bill reduction and part of their capacity often remains idle or underutilized, while their aggregated underutilized capacities can be used to provide grid services through an advanced control mechanism. Nonetheless, integration of the growing number of aforementioned DERs, especially those located behind the customers' meters, significantly impacts the size and complexity of the network operation problem and is a challenge to a central DER management system (DERMS). In this thesis, a decentralized agent-based control framework is proposed for a DER management system that facilitates the scalable operation of DERs. The focus is on improving the utilization of the BESS to provide multiple services in order to justify their costs. In this framework, initially, the prosumer agents schedule their resources for daily cost management based on time-of-use energy price and demand charge, considering the day-ahead demand and PV forecasts. Thereafter, a local customer aggregator (LCA) agent performs day-ahead active and reactive power control on the underutilized BTM capacities for providing multiple grid services, including network bottleneck congestion relief and grid-edge voltage support.In order to deal with the uncertainties in the demand and generation forecasts, a novel near-real-time (NRT) approach is proposed to utilize the utility-owned medium-scale BESS to provide area power regulation. The proposed approach improves the utilization of the BESS by using their remaining capacity for the secondary service of congestion relief. A novel algorithm is developed based on a modified $k$-means clustering method for grouping the customers to be assigned to LCAs.In this work, a linear programming (LP) model is used to formulate various optimization problems associated with different BESS applications and scheduling stages. A linearized power flow model is developed based on multivariate linear regression applied to a synthetic dataset, in order to simplify the inclusion of power flow constraints in the linear optimization problems.The proposed framework is applied to case studies and the simulation results are compared to those of a central control framework in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",
"Development of a CFD Simulation Framework for Aerothermal Analyses of Electric Vehicle Battery Packs","Jain, Ayushi",2021,"Lithium-ion batteries (LIB) are widely being used in the field of electric vehicles, their high-power density, low resistance, compactness and low self-discharge rate. These make LIBs an ideal choice for use in electric vehicles (EV). To increase the reliability of LIBs, a proper battery thermal management system is required. This thesis presents a finite volume based Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) aero-thermal analysis for a pack of high energy density cylindrical lithium-ion batteries. This study presents first the development of a CFD framework required for a comprehensive aero-thermal investigation. This includes investigations on the effectiveness of turbulence modeling approaches in capturing local hot-spots developed for a range of inlet velocities and configurations of the lithium-ion battery pack. Turbulence models investigated include Mentors SST k-ω, Launder and Spalding standard k-ε, realizable k-ε and elliptic blending k-ε. The results from these simulations are compared against published experimental wind-tunnel data. Simcenter Battery Design Studio (BDS) is used to generate a detailed and in-dept model of the LG INR 18650 MJ1 (LiNiCoMnO2) cell. The cell from BDS is imported in Simcenter Starccm+ 2020.2 where the simulation is set-up to monitor voltage variation, discharge rate current, temperature distribution within the pack, maximum temperature of aligned, staggered, and cross configuration for various inlet velocities. The results of these simulations are compared, and it is found that, in spite of all its short comings, the standard k-ε model is the most accurate model for such analysis. It is also observed that the dependency of heat generation on discharge current is significant, the battery performance is affected by the ambient temperature, and the aligned arrangement has the best temperature uniformity and cooling effectiveness. Lastly, there is significant effect on the stability of the simulation depending on the way the boundary condition is modeled is projected.",
"Diagnostic Ultrasound Assessment of Femoral Cartilage Health in Individuals with Patellofemoral Pain","Jeon, Hyunjae",2021,"Patients with patellofemoral pain (PFP) experience pain during or after physical activities. Recent evidence suggests PFP is not only a painful symptom which hinders daily activity but also a potential marker for future development of patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA). Ultimately, PFP may also lead to tibiofemoral osteoarthritis (TFOA), which is recognized as a knee osteoarthritis. Traditionally, lower extremity strengthening exercises successfully alleviate pain for patients with PFP. However, strengthening exercises are not effective in modifying certain movement patterns associated with PFP development and progression. Researchers found feedback motion retraining to be an effective mode of intervention to alter movement patterns. However, there is no research synthesizing the efficacy of feedback motion retraining for patients with PFP. Therefore, in Chapter 2, we assessed the efficacy of feedback motion retraining by summarizing relevant scientific evidence. Diagnostic ultrasound (US) is a cost-effective imaging tool to assess morphology of soft tissue, but it is rarely used for evaluating cartilage health in individuals with PFP. But, diagnostic US may be a useful clinical tool for understanding the progression from PFP to PFOA. Therefore, our aims were to evaluate femoral cartilage health in patients with PFP. In Chapter 3, we compared the deformative characteristics of femoral cartilage following varied forms of loading conditions between individuals with and without PFP by assessing US image cross-sectional area and echo intensity. In Chapter 4, we compared the image quality gradebetween individuals with and without PFP to understand whether individuals with PFP are demonstrating worse cartilage health that may not be captured using traditional evaluation methods. We identified significant correlations between patient-reported outcomes and echo intensity following loading conditions. We also identified statistically significant differences of femoral cartilage image quality between individuals with and without PFP which indicates increased risk of osteoarthritis in individuals with PFP.",
"Dietary Identity At Salango: Stable Light Isotope Analysis Of Guangala Period Burials (100 BCE – 800 CE)","Cobb, Emilie",2021,"Salango is an archaeological site on the coast of Ecuador that has been inhabited for thousands of years by multiple different cultures, including the Guangala (100 BCE- 400 CE). While research about mortuary treatment and socio-cultural characteristics has been conducted for the Guangala people, there is a lack of research about diet and/or using biogeochemical studies. This thesis utilizes stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen in order to determine what dietary resources were consumed by the Very Early Guangala (VEG) and Early Guangala (EG) people buried at Salango. The sample includes individuals of various sexes and age groups. Results of this research show that these individuals were consuming mostly marine protein sources, which is to be expected for the area, and C4 resources (maize). Comparisons between demographic groups (sex and age), time periods (VEG and EG), and other sites in Ecuador and the Andes region highlight some variation in diet. These comparisons show isotopes statistically differed between time periods, and between infants and older individuals in the sample. Comparisons between contemporaneous cultures in Ecuador show similar overall diets but differ in protein consumption, likely due to difference in geographic location. Overall, these data show that people living at Salango took advantage of abundant local resources and generally shared access to foodstuffs, although some restriction in dietary options occurred over time",
"Differences Between Resident Advisors And Undergraduate Residential Students On Resilience, Mental Health, Burnout, And Perceived Stress","Harris, Corrine",2021,"The mental health and well-being of college students has become a growing concern for colleges and universities. Research has shown that prevalence rates of mental health in college students is growing and there are multiple complicating impacts of mental health on student well-being and academic success. Resident advisors play a crucial role in campus life as student employees that live amongst students and have a high level of responsibility as first responders to emergencies and as rule enforcers. Despite their importance, there is little research on the mental health of resident advisors and how different aspects of the resident advisor role impact their mental health.The purpose of this study was to examine the differences between resident advisors and undergraduate residential students on measures of mental health, burnout, and perceived stress. The study also examined how different aspects of the resident advisor position may impact resident advisor mental health, burnout, and stress and if resilience had a mediating impact on these variables. A total of 551 college students (including 84 resident advisors) were included in this research study. Participants completed an online survey, which included the Mental Health Inventory, Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, Perceived Stress Scale, Scale of Protective Factors, and a demographic questionnaire. The multivariate analysis of variance indicated that there were no statistically significant differences between resident advisors and undergraduate residential college students on mental health, burnout, and perceived stress. A multivariate analysis of covariance indicated that there was not a significant difference between the groups on the combined dependent variables after controlling for resilience. The findings of the present study suggest that resident advisors and residential college students are experiencing symptoms of mental health, burnout, and perceived stress that exist despite moderate levels of resilience. Results suggest that university staff who work with students should be aware of the mental health challenges of students and work to find ways to support them.",
"Doula Care in California during COVID-19: The Impacts of Social Distancing on a High-Touch Helping Profession.","Lisenbee, Jodie",2021,"Birth doula care was uniquely impacted by hospital visitor restriction policies enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Doulas were classified as ""non-essential"" personnel and thus generally excluded from providing in-hospital childbirth support. Research demonstrates that birth doulas, who attend approximately 6% of births, have significant positive impacts on various maternal and infant health outcomes, including psychological well-being. The present study drew upon social action theory to highlight the role that doulas played in supporting their clients’ self-change processes (e.g., problem-solving, outcome expectancies, self-efficacy, goal structures, cognitive schemas), which in turn influenced the extent to which pandemic-related disruptions to socio-environmental contexts threatened perinatal health outcomes. This research employed a methodologically rigorous, contextually bound, qualitative case study design to examine the impacts of visitor restriction policies and other contextual factors on doula services in the San Francisco Bay Area. This highlighted ways in which doulas adapted their services to continue delivering care and supported their clients in adapting to giving birth during the unusual circumstances of the 2020 Coronavirus disease outbreak. In-depth, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 15 birth doulas, paired with a brief online survey. Findings contribute to our broad knowledge of the impacts of COVID-19 on maternal and child health care delivery and garner a more nuanced understanding of psychosocial interventions that may underlie the demonstrated positive effects of doula care on health outcomes. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",
"Dr. Madge Baker Gaskin: The Making of a Woman Physician in the 1920s","Gaskin, Rachael",2021,"During the 1920s, women who aspired to be doctors often found the South unwelcoming. Women interested in the medical profession, encountered multiple roadblocks when they applied to medical school programs because of sexist stereotypes and cultural expectations. These categorizations relegated women to home concerns and this subservient status conflicted with the common perceptions of male professionalism in the medical field. Nevertheless, in 1926 Madge Baker Gaskin overcame gender discrimination and challenged accepted social norms to graduate from the Medical College of South Carolina in Charleston. By discussing Baker’s exceptional experiences as a medical student, resident, and practicing physician in the 1930s, this biography contributes to the historical scholarship of Southern women medical students and physicians during the first decades of the twentieth century.",
"Durability, Indirect Bankruptcy Costs, and Capital Structure","Shah, Dhara",2021,"I contribute to the literature by formally modeling the indirect bankruptcy costs for a firm that sells durable goods. Consumers concerned about warranties or future product services penalize the distressed firm by putting off purchases or leaving the market. Subsequent lower demand of durable goods generates lower cashflows for the firm, and these lost profits are larger if the firm produces more durable goods. In a parsimonious framework, I show that the loss in profitability (i.e., indirect bankruptcy costs) significantly lowers the firm’s demand for leverage. I also acknowledge that there is an innate consumer demand for durability (i.e., useful life of a product) and show that the firm supplies lower durability than the market demands. Other than the cost of producing durable goods, indirect bankruptcy costs limit the firm’s choice of durability. Finally, I also show that if the firm has a valuable innovation option, it exercises the option sooner to offset bankruptcy costs of durability.",
"EKF Accelerometer Wheel Based Odometry","Morgan, Jacob",2021,"Gathering information on robot motion is critical in determining how a mobile robothas interacted in its environment. The information about a robot’s motion, called odometry is generally collected by tracking wheel behavior for ground based robots. Wheel encoders are a typical means for collecting this information. Wheel encoders generally split the circumference of the wheel into equally discrete distances to track the distance traveled along the wheel’s circumference. The proposal of this research is to dismiss the use of the above discrete based wheel encoders and use an accelerometer as a wheel encoder for a more continuous reading of the wheel’s position. Accelerometers are typically difficult to use for precise data collection because of noisy outputs causing inaccurate odometry information. This can be overcome by building a model to predict how the output of the accelerometer on the wheel should behave. With the accelerometer mounted on the wheel of a ground based robot, an expected output of the accelerometer should oscillate between positive and negative values of the gravity vector. This allows for a system that can be modelled as a sinusoid. Using the sinusoidal model, the raw data can then be filtered with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The Extended Kalman Filter weights the measurement from the sensor along with the predicted value from the model to give a low noise, high precision output. The results from the newly filtered data proved to give acceptable accuracy that was desired for estimating position of the wheel. Based on the filtered data, the calculated distance proved to remain within %2.2 of the expected distance traveled for each trial run of the experimental. The trend of the error also leads to the belief that this error is not likely to increase inside the testing environment.",
"Educational Needs Assessment for African Americans with Homeschooled Children","Rhyne Byrd, Kelly",2021,"Trends in homeschooling show that enrollment for K-12 students is on the rise, particularly with African American families. For families choosing to homeschool their children, there is greater flexibility and range of choice in curriculum programs and instructional practices. Data from this Phenomenological case study was collected using interviews and surveys in an effort to understand and identify the educational needs of African American families who homeschool their children. Using interviews, this study explored the homeschooling needs and experiences of African American families through shared experiences. This study also analyzed the need to include Afrocentric and multicultural teachings as part of a homeschool curriculum. By using constant comparative to analyze the data, the researcher was able to and identify trends across the homeschool experience for African Americans and define five major themes: 1) Accessibility and Availability of Resources, 2) Homeschool Setting and Structure, 3) Instructional Support, 4) Working Parents and Homeschooling, and 5) Cultural Representation in Education. Two minor themes emerged as well: 1) Problem Based Learning and 2) Socialization outside of the Home. The results of this study are crucial to the development and implementation of curriculum, the use of instructional practices, and the access and availability of educational resources within a homeschool setting.

"Effects of E-Cigarette Education in Adolescents and Young Adults in Primary Care","Carriker, Amy",2021,"ABSTRACT AMY E. CARRIKER. Effects of E-Cigarette Education in Adolescents and Young Adults in Primary Care. (Under the direction of DR. TONYA ANDERSON) Approximately one in five high school student and 1 in 20 middle school students currently use e-cigarettes. The burgeoning number of e-cigarette users from 2017 to 2018, 1.5 million more, prompted the U.S. Surgeon General to declare an e-cigarette epidemic among teens. Serious health problems, such as bronchiolitis obliterans, DNA damage, increased risk for developing asthma and COPD, seizures, anoxic brain injury, elevated blood pressure, elevated heart rate, and myocardial infarction has been associated with exposure of toxic chemicals in the e-liquids that is heated to produce an aerosol and inhaled into the lungs. The long-term effects of e-cigarettes is unknown with research still in its infancy with only a little over 10 years since first introduced in the U.S. Despite a recent decline in the estimated users in 2020, adolescents and young adults continue to use e-cigarettes. The purpose of this scholarly project is to educate teens and young adults about the harmful effects of e-cigarettes in an effort to reduce e-cigarette use among current users. Objectives were to evaluate participants knowledge of perceived harms, implement e-cigarette education, and determine if the education encouraged a reduction in use or promote e-cigarette cessation. A quasi-experimental pre-posttest intervention quality improvement project was implemented at a rural family practice clinic in the southeastern region of the U. S. Participants were between the ages of 13 – 24 who vaped daily, randomized between an intervention group and control group, and administered 3 questionnaires (Initial Questionnaire, PESCDI, and E-cigarette Reasons for Use Scale). Intervention group viewed an educational video on the harms of e-cigarettes. PESCDI was administered as a posttest 2-4 weeks following appointment in the clinic. Initial Questionnaire results revealed that 76% of participants were female and the top 2 reasons for use were curiosity/peer-pressure/friends that use and flavors/tastes good. Majority believed that e-cigarettes were equally harmful (41%) and less harmful (41%) than tobacco cigarettes. Wilcoxon signed-rank test analysis of the PSECDI did not show that the educational intervention was statistically significant, however, median scores in the intervention group decreased indicating an overall decrease in nicotine dependency. Median scores in the control group did increase on posttest denoting a higher nicotine dependence on follow-up. Fisher’s exact tests compared pre and posttests according to categories, although not statistically significant, revealed that the intervention groups posttest PSECDI dependency decreased in the medium and low dependency categories and increased in the not dependent category representative of a clinically significant decline in nicotine dependency. One participant progressed from not dependent to low dependency. Limitations of the project include a small sample size due to small rural family practice and COVID-19 pandemic limiting the number of patients in the office. Future implications include replicating project at multiple sites for larger sample size to determine a statistical significance.",
"Effects of an Asynchronous Online Intervention on Secondary General Educator Knowledge, Application, Confidence, and Generalization of the Predictors of Postschool Success","Kwiatek, Stephen",2021,"Federal legislation has mandated students with and without disabilities be prepared for college and careers (ESSA, 2015; IDEA, 2004). Students with high-incidence disabilities experience less success than their peers without disabilities (Newman et al., 2011). Initially, college and career readiness efforts lacked a focus on students with disabilities (e.g., Conley 2007, 2008), but recent efforts have increased the focus on students with disabilities (e.g., Morningstar et al., 2017). The predictors of postschool success appear to be a viable option to bridge both efforts. Students with high-incidence disabilities spend at least part of their day in general education classes (NCES, 2017b), but general education teachers report wanting additional information to prepare students with high-incidence disabilities for college and careers (Kwiatek, 2017). General educators identified the predictors of postschool success as relevant, important, and feasible for implementation (Kwiatek et al., 2021). Coupling the alignment between secondary transition and college and career readiness, the predictors of postschool success appear to be an ideal option to provide general educators with professional development to prepare students with high-incidence disabilities for college and careers. The purpose of this dissertation was to examine the effects of an asynchronous online intervention (i.e., General Educators Now Embedding Research [for] Adult Life in Educational Design [GENERAL ED]) on general education teachers’ knowledge of research-based and evidence-based, in-school predictors of postschool success. Results of this intervention indicated a functional relation between the asynchronous online intervention and increased knowledge of three predictors of postschool success. Effect sizes were large for increased knowledge of the predictors of postschool success. Additional measures included application; confidence; generalization; and social validity (i.e., feasibility evaluation, intervention rating scale). Finally, limitations, suggestions for future research, and implications for practice will be discussed.",
"Efficient and Scalable Highway Asset Detection","Bhojwani, Ekta",2021,"The roads and highways are a valuable asset for the state department of transportation. It takes massive investment and a huge amount of time to maintain the road assets condition. Therefore, it becomes important to automate the maintenance process with minimum manual inspection. There has been significant research in the domain of classical computer vision techniques and machine learning methods concerning highway and road assets maintenance. However, the time consumed to assess and maintain and the amount of manual inspection involved is considerably large. Although adding automation to speed up the inspection process has been investigated by many studies, they overshadow the importance of scalable and light frameworks detecting the assets like storm drain and drop inlet in real-time. Thus, this thesis focuses on integrating a reliable and scalable AI Deep Learning framework customized for highway assets localization and detection of the assets in a road infrastructure environment mitigating the need for large and bulky model sizes. Furthermore, utilizing the advantage of the less computational cost and the lightweight framework architecture along with reasonably higher accuracy, it is possible to build an end-to-end framework that supports object localization and detection followed by the inference on the mobile edge embedded platforms. In a nutshell, this thesis presents a Deep Learning localization platform, customized to predict the position or the location of the asset items on the Highways such as drop inlets and storm drains. Moreover, it also provides results on the scalability of the localization task to the multi-object detection task with the help the state of the art EfficientDet-D0 model with a test accuracy of 73.4\% mAP on the annotated test dataset and achieving validation accuracy of 51.67\% mAP on the customized merged data of highway asset item drop inlet and 5 other COCO classes for object detection application. Additionally, various analyses based on mIOU and classification scores are described in the experimental section below. It also represents that the model framework is edge deployable friendly and can be quantized to an Fp16 lighter version of the model with help of the NVIDIA TensorRT engine showing the benchmarking performance of 50.55 FPS on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier mobile embedded platform. Moreover, it highlights the challenges and the future scope expansion of the work to the real-time onboard drone visual analytics for Highway assets defect detection.",
"Emerging Challenges in Landfill Leachate Quality and Ability of Fungal Bioreactors to Address Them","Rezaei Adaryani, Amirhossein",2021,"Landfill sites, that are the ultimate depository of solid waste stream in most societies, have the potential to generate leachate containing a complex mixture of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) such as pharmaceutical compounds, plasticizers, and endocrine disrupting compounds, which can have negative effects on human and ecosystem health. More than 60% of the landfills in the U.S. discharge leachate to publicly owned treatment works (POTW), i.e. municipal wastewater treatment plants, because of its convenience and low cost. Apart from CECs, UV absorbing substances (UVAS) can cause major disruption to the effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes and often require pretreatment of leachate prior to discharge to POTW. Literature suggests that white-rot fungi are able to degrade both types of contaminants.This work investigated the removal of a selection of CECs and UVAS in real landfill leachate with non-sterile aerobic bench scale reactors utilizing Phanerochaete chrysosporium in pellet form. Batch and column plug flow reactor were used in this study, and finally treated LL was evaluated for biotoxicity with activated sludge respiration inhibition test. Meanwhile, the leachate from four landfills with various closure status was tested for occurrence of CECs. The study found that phenol, a regulated compound in LL, was consistently removed in both batch and plug flow reactors. Acetaminophen was removed significantly as well. Fungal reactors were not efficient in reducing UV absorbance while they were effective in removal of carbon content up to about 40%. Landfill leachate characteristics in water quality parameters and CECs occurrence were variable among landfills of different closure status. While differences in some instances were statistically significant, they were not sufficient to justify different treatment approach to leachate based on closure status.",
"Empowering Reconfigurable Platforms for Massively Parallel Applications","Purkayastha, Arnab A",2021,"The availability of OpenCL for FPGAs along with High-Level Synthesis tools have made them an attractive platform for implementing compute-intensive massively parallel applications. FPGAs with their customizable data-path, deep pipelining abilities and enhanced power efficiency features offer the most viable solutions for programming and integrating them with heterogeneous platforms. However, OpenCL for FPGAs raise many design challenges which require an in-depth understanding to better utilize their enormous capabilities. Inefficient routing of data, high number of memory stalls exposed to execution and under-utilization of FPGA resources are significant execution bottlenecks that overshadow the advantages of data-path customization. Furthermore, leveraging OpenCL parallelism abilities and throughput oriented principles is paramount to the success of FPGAs in the high performance computing environment.In this research, we identify, analyze and categorize the architectural differences between the OpenCL parallel programming model and FPGA execution semantic. We propose a generic taxonomy for classifying FPGA parallelism potential to the fullest. To benefit massive thread-level parallelism, we introduce a unique LLVM based automation tool to decouple memory access from computation, thereby hiding memory stalls from the execution path. We further present a novel parallelism granularity that separates kernels to split them into data-path and memory-path (memory read/write) that work concurrently to overlap the computation of current threads with the memory access of future threads. We validate these principles on the Xilinx based AWS Cloud FPGA platform.We then conduct a thorough investigation into the scalability of OpenCL coarse-grain parallelism, as well as an examination of Compute Unit(CU) replication, Double Data Rate (DDR) and Burst Transfer (BT) optimizations on Cloud FPGAs. To address the issue of programming challenges, we present generic template(s) and a front end design tool to aid the programmer in rapid exploration and testing. Overall, this dissertation is an amalgamation of principles and techniques to improve the performance and programmability of OpenCL on FPGAs when running massively parallel applications on 'Edge' as well as the 'Cloud'.",

"Environmental Evolution of Supercells Interacting with the Appalachian Mountains","Purpura, Sarah",2021,"The Appalachian Mountains within the eastern United States have a considerable impact on day-to-day weather, including severe convection. However, the impact of the Appalachians on supercell thunderstorms is not well understood, posing a significant short-term forecast challenge across the region. While there have been some individual case studies conducted, there has yet to be a broad analysis of storm-scale modifications of supercells as they interact with complex terrain. To address this gap, this study examined 62 isolated supercells that occurred within the central and southern Appalachians between April and July from 2009 to 2019. Each supercell was broadly classified as either a ""crosser"" or ""non-crosser"" based on their ability to be maintained during their interaction with terrain; the majority of supercells (37) were not sustained downstream of the Appalachians. To identify the environmental controls resulting in crossing or non-crossing storms, near-storm model soundings (either the Rapid Update Cycle or the Rapid Refresh) were collected for each supercell at three points: (1) upstream of the mountains, (2) near the peak of the terrain, (3) and downstream of the terrain feature. These soundings were used to compute a number of different thermodynamic and kinematic parameters. Results indicate that the lowest 3 km of shear and storm-relative helicity (SRH) appear to best distinguish crossing and non-crossing supercells. Conversely, instability (CAPE and CIN) do not appear to be useful parameters in differentiating between crossers and non-crossers. Forecasters can use the lowest 3 km of SRH and shear, as well as the surface and mixed-layer equivalent potential temperature (θ_e) to aid in the short-term forecasting of isolated crossing supercells. Additionally, syntopic pattern recognition (e.g., the tilt of the upper-level trough, location of the surface low pressure, and the boundary type) of these events may help forecasters identify if supercells will cross the Appalachian Mountains.",
"Essays in Empirical Asset Pricing","Mo, Xi",2021,"This dissertation contains two essays on empirical asset pricing. The first essay tests a two-beta currency pricing model that features betas with risk-premium news and real-rate news of the currency market. I find that the beta associated with risk-premium news is ``bad'' because of a significantly positive price of risk of $2.52\%$ per year; beta with global real-rate news is ``good'' because of a negative price of risk. Moreover, I show that the price of risk-premium-beta risk is countercyclical, whereas the price of the real-rate beta risk is procyclical. Under my two-beta asset pricing model, most prevailing currency trading strategies have either excessive ``bad beta'' or too little ``good beta'', thus fail to deliver abnormal performance. The main driver of the results is precautionary savings, consistent with my theoretical implications.In the second essay, I test whether the trend factor works across different countries and markets. I find consistent evidence that the trend factor which captures information in moving average prices of various time lengths, can generate positive Sharpe ratio across most of the developed countries. It outperforms the market portfolio, short-term reversal, momentum, and long-term reversal in most of the developed countries. I further examine how cultural differences influence the success of the trend factor. The empirical results show that the trend factor is more profitable in countries where the individualism is higher. The performance of the global trend factor is robust to different subperiods and subsamples. From an asset pricing perspective, it also performs well in explaining returns of global portfolios sorted based on different attributes.",
"Evaluating the impact of working in an online environment","Richardson, Kara; Ambroise, Sharmily",2021,"Research has found that peer mentorship can play a valuable role in a student’s personal growth and development. At UNC Charlotte, the Communication Across the Curriculum program trains communication consultants to serve as peer mentors and provide one-on-one support to students within select classes. Unlike past semesters, consultants primarily worked remotely throughout Fall 2020 due to a global pandemic. This applied research project investigates the impact of working in an online environment on the communication consultant experience. In Fall 2019 and Fall 2020, consultants completed an online survey consisting of Likert scale and open-ended questions that asked them to reflect on their confidence levels in general and in different aspects of their role. In Fall 2020, consultants also were asked to report on different barriers they faced related to the online environment. Consultant survey results from Fall 2019 and Fall 2020 were compared to analyze how communication consultant confidence changed between the 2019 and 2020 school years. Additionally, open-ended questions on the surveys were coded to identify different factors that impacted confidence levels. Findings suggest that while confidence levels in particular areas were negatively impacted from the lack of in-person communication, confidence levels overall remained high and confidence with online communication greatly increased.","Education; Communication"
"Evaluation of Acute Care Providers' Opioid Prescribing Practices in Chronic Non-Cancer Pain","Buckner, Kimberly",2021,"Over 760,000 people have died from an opioid overdose since 1999. In 2019, the opioid epidemic claimed more than 70,000 lives, with over 1.6 million having an opioid use disorder. Literature suggests an association between increased opioid prescribing and increased opioid addiction; limiting the number of opioid prescriptions written may reduce opioid addiction. There is variation in opioid prescribing practices among acute care providers and opioid prescribing education has been proven to optimize prescribing in the acute care setting. This quality improvement project sought to minimize the use of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain by adhering to the Centers for Disease Control Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. Twenty-five acute-care providers including medical doctors, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants participated. This project included a pre-test to measure providers baseline pain management knowledge, an educational module, and a post-test. Retrospective chart audits were performed on records of patients discharged from the acute care setting from July to August 2020 with an opioid for chronic non-cancer pain prior to implementation of educational intervention and again January to February 2021 post-implementation. Comparison of the pre-and-post-test surveys revealed learning in several areas. Though not statistically significant, (Pre: 40.4; Post: 41.3, p=.276), efficacy of the educational session was evident by improved test scores, pre-test (M = 40.4, SD = 3.5) and post-test (M = 41.3, SD = 4.7). The average number of opioid prescriptions by provider decreased significantly in the post-intervention period (Pre: 3.4; Post: .24, p<.000). Results suggest that implementing opioid-prescribing guidelines can reduce sub-optimal opioid prescribing in the acute care setting, thereby reducing the number of available opioids in the community for diversion and abuse.",
"Evidence-Based and Makerspaced: Preservice Teachers’ Dispositions, Perceptions, and Preparedness to Teach Students with Emotional and Behavioral Disabilities","Holland, Abby",2021,"The purpose of this qualitative research project was to explore the perceptions, practices, and roles that a team of six (6) preservice teachers developed regarding make-based learning, which is informed by constructionism and teaching students with emotional and behavioral disabilities. Participants were students in a seminar course that involved weekly clinical visits to the makerspace inside a separate public school for students with exceptional emotional and behavioral needs. They also spent one afternoon per month designing and carrying out projects in a university makerspace. Data included written observation forms and written assignments, spoken narratives through individual interviews, and photographic evidence of the artifacts that participants created in the university makerspace. Three common themes emerged across participants: (1) making connects to social-emotional learning, which can benefit students with EBD; (2) time in school reserved for the makerspace should not be overshadowed by library visits or other activities; and (3) using evidence-based practices is not the only pathway to finding ""what works""",
"Examining Policy, Enabler And Access Factor Effects On U.S State Medicaid Pharmaceutical Utilization And Expenditures","EGHAN, EMMANUEL",2021,"Prescription drug expenditures and utilization are the fastest growing and most widely varying expenditures within Medicaid programs across US states. The passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 and the subsequent Medicaid state expansions resulted in very large coverage gains among several demographics. Prior to the ACA a number of studies highlighting determinants of overall healthcare utilization and expenditures had been undertaken. Most of these studies examined discreet determinants for overall health care. However, these determinants, their interactions have not been tested concurrently in relation to pharmaceutical expenditures. Data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), US Department of Labor, Department of Education, and state Medicaid programs were merged to create a balanced panel data (n=350 observations and 53 variables over a seven (7) period from 2009 to 2015). Based on Andersen’s Behavioral Model of Health Services, and using STATA-16, a random effects (RE) panel regression analysis is undertaken to estimate an econometric model for Medicaid pharmaceutical expenditures. A Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Model is developed to examine the relationships between and test the hypothesized effects of policy, access and predisposing factors on State Medicaid expenditures. The model estimate showed a significant influence on drug expenditures of state non-drug Medicaid expenditures, proportion of males in the population, and provider education programs on generics. Discussions, limitations and future directions for research are stated",
"Experimental Study on Autocorrelated Femtosecond-Laser Ablation of Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides","Obeid, Joseph",2021,"In this experimental study, we use a pair of 800 nm 180 fs ultrafast laser pulses to explore time-resolved enhanced ablation of two monolayer transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). A 2D crystal structure gives monolayer TMDs their unique properties including a direct electronic band gap, large excitonic resonances, and strong light-matter interactions. As a result, TMDs are of primary interest in optoelectronics. Our TMD samples are CVD grown molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2). For comparison, another common ultra-thin material, graphene, is studied. Our optical setup provides sub 100 femtosecond resolution by using a variable delay stage that allows up to 433 ps delay between pulses. Fundamentally, below some fluence threshold, the first incident pulse will interact with the sample, producing a memory that temporarily affects its electronic behavior. If the second pulse arrives before this memory dissipates, an enhanced ablation process will ensue. To characterize the evolution of this phenomenon, we analyze the autocorrelated ablation area-delay and ablation threshold-delay relationships. From our measurements, we extract the lifetimes of the enhanced ablation processes and draw conclusions on the photoelectronic nature of our TMDs. Our results show that the enhanced ablation process in MoS2 has a mean lifetime of ~32 ps with total enhancement ending after 150 ps. This agrees with the partial mean lifetime of C-excitons derived in previous pump-probe experiments. Extracted lifetimes for WS2 demonstrate two possible ablation dynamics. The first lifetime is 58 ps, on par with the relaxation of the A-exciton after excitation, while the second is a much slower decay process in the ~700 ps regime. Graphene shows evidence for coulomb explosion in the sub ps regime with a secondary peak resonance at ~150 ps and no ablation beyond 250 ps. The ablation threshold for MoS2 demonstrates a mostly linear dependence on delay while the WS2 threshold shows two distinct linear regimes. For both, their dependence degrades below ~1ps where bandgap renormalization begins to take place and the carrier dynamics are drastically different from later delays.",
"Exploring The Effect of Mentoring Programs for Both Private and Public Sectors: Formal and Informal Relationships","McCrowre, Rodney",2021,"Studies on mentoring projects have highlighted the polarization of subjects, unique to the role of mentoring relationships, the role of that mentor, and the influences of those groups through an individual's journey toward career development. This quantitative study aims to match and cross reference a network of people that have experienced informal and well-regulated relationships within various organizations. This study aims to examine the association of two types of fit and achievement goals, as well as examine the influence of mentorship on the relationship between fit and two dimensions of achievement goals (Mastery Approach and Performance Approach). The research is grounded in traditional management theories of person-organization fit theory, person-job fit theory, mentorship theory and achievement goals theory. The research provides a framework to examine the role of these predictor variables and their effectiveness within the business sector.

"Exploring factors impacting social justice advocacy attitudes among play therapists","Chase, Lauren",2021,"Overall, the United States’ population is becoming more diverse, and children in minority groups have many disadvantages due to circumstances beyond their control. They experience more poverty (US Census Bureau, 2017), unequal educational opportunities (US Census Bureau, 2019), discriminatory practices (Pascoe & Smart Richman, 2009), trauma (Sacks & Murphey, 2018), mental health diagnoses, and inadequate mental health services. Mental health professionals who work with children, specifically play therapists, are called to be more responsive to the increase in diversity of the growing population of children. To support diverse children and support therapists in offering responsive services and advocate on behalf of children, researchers need to explore factors that may influence their social justice advocacy attitudes. Therefore, a standard multiple regression was utilized to examine the impact of play therapists’ (N=409) adverse childhood experiences, attitudes related to trauma-informed care, and cultural humility with regard to their social justice advocacy attitudes. Results indicated that attitudes related to trauma-informed care and cultural humility contributed significantly to the prediction of social justice advocacy attitudes, accounting for 11% of the variance. Implications, limitations, and recommendations for future research are discussed.",
"Factors Affecting Grades: An Examination of North Carolina School Performance Grades","Dangerfield-Persky, Felicia",2021,"This quantitative study explores the potential school-level and school district-level factors associated with North Carolina school performance grades in K-5 elementary schools. The desire was to examine if any of the school- or school district-level factors were associated with the outcome variable of North Carolina school performance grades. This study used the data from the North Carolina school report cards and Civil Rights Data Collection from the 2015 – 2016 school year. The sample had 1096 schools and 92 school districts. A hierarchical linear model was created with the overall school performance grade as the outcome variable and the sixteen school level predictors and thirteen school district predictors. Results indicated that twelve out of sixteen school-level variables were statistically significant. One out of thirteen school district-level variables were statistically significant and two additional variables approached significance. Recommendations for improving student achievement were provided for United States policymakers, university education programs, North Carolina policymakers, local governments, school districts, and schools. These recommendations are presented as opportunities to ensure equitable educational practices and outcomes for all students.  ",
"Factors Influencing Veteran Entrepreneurial Intention","Bryant, Tamara",2021,"Veteran business owners are essential contributors to American society and the U. S. economy. Statistics showed a looming drawdown of military personnel and comparatively higher unemployment rates than the civilian population, which led to a growing interest in assisting veterans with entrepreneurship. Studies show that military service has a strong association with entrepreneurship. Few studies have identified key factors of veteran business ownership and action-oriented questions on how or why veteran entrepreneurs find their way to business ownership. There are calls in the literature to answer the question of whether entrepreneurial competencies can influence entrepreneurial intentions. Veterans are often faced with the challenge of building a second career following separation from the military. There is limited research about what factors may motivate and support their transition to self-employment or how they fare compared to nonveteran employees. Furthermore, there are no studies that examine the role of resilience in the entrepreneurial process related to American Veteran Entrepreneurs. The purpose of the study is to determine if resilience and entrepreneurial competencies influence veteran entrepreneurial intention to start a business. This study examines the relationship between entrepreneurial competencies and entrepreneurial intentions among Veterans.",
"Fan Noise Attenuation with an Acoustic Metamaterial","Hill, Ryan",2021,"In a world continuously increasing in the number of electronic devices, the need for cooling fans increases and so does its contribution to noise pollution. This project explores a solution to this problem by designing an acoustic metamaterial that attenuates the fan noise from a Sofasco fan, whose fundamental blade pass frequencyis approximately 800 Hz. According to Ping, two Helmholtz resonators (HRs) that are parallel side branched to a waveguide whose distance is less than a wavelength will have a hybrid resonance at the difference average. This approach did not work with the first generation samples, but the use of two parallel HRs was used in future designs. According to Sang-Hyun, the attenuation increases logarithmically for each parallel HR side branched to a waveguide. Using Sang-Hyun method, a second generation sample was designed that achieved a transmission loss of 45 dB, but it had an airflow loss of 75%. Other second generation designs explored decreasing the airflow loss, but none of the methods were successful. The third generation design has a waveguide shaped as a truncated sector, which increases the cross-sectional area of the waveguide as well as the airflow. The best sample of the third generation design had a transmission loss of 30 dB with an airflow loss of 45%. In an attempt to further decrease the airflow loss, the fourth generation design placed two HRs connected in series with each other (dual HRs) a side branch to the waveguide. The airflow loss was reduced to less than 1% with transmission loss of approximately 18 dB at 496 Hz and 1250 Hz. This design also led to a transmission loss of approximately 8 dB from 582 Hz to 1000 Hz. This design was never modified to achieve the fan frequency of800 Hz, but this can be achieved using design equations for dual HRs.",
"Feasibility and acceptability of a Body Kindness guided self-help intervention for emerging adult women","Rogers, Courtney",2021,"Based on the extant literature, new and innovative strategies for preventing the development of disordered eating in emerging adulthood appear to be an important area of future focus. This study examined the effects of a GSH intervention for the prevention of disordered eating via addressing both risk factors and protective factors in a population that is at increased risk for disordered eating. Results indicated a high level of engagement and satisfaction with the intervention. Proof of concept was preliminarily supported by the observed significant changes in all variables of interest across the intervention. Overall, results of this study suggest that the use of a GSH program which seeks to reduce risk factors for EDs while also supporting current wellbeing and adaptive functioning may be indicated for emerging adult women. Although interpretation of results is limited by factors such as a small sample size and lack of randomization, the study provides the groundwork for continued intervention development and investigations (e.g., randomized controlled trials) supporting efficacious, feasible strategies for addressing a significant concern in a crucial period of life.",
"Financial Market Innovation and Product Innovation: Evidence from Commodity Futures Markets and Stock Markets","Kong, Lingfei",2021,"This dissertation contains three connected essays that feature financial market innovation and product market innovation. Two essays feature return predictability in commodity futures, which have been financialized during the past two decades. One essay studies the relation between CEO’s external job market tournament and product innovation in the stock market. The first essay uses machine learning tools to study the serial dependence (lead-lag relations) of commodity futures returns. We use LASSO to select the predictors because the number of independent variables is large relative to the number of data points. We find significant full-sample and out-of-sample predictability. In the full sample, we find that LASSO can identify a sparse set of predictors that either come from economically linked commodities or are likely driven by excessive speculative trading. The out-of-sample forecasts based on LASSO generate statistically and economically large performance. When we use more complex machine learning models such as neural networks and regression trees to forecast commodity futures returns, the out-of-sample performance is worse than LASSO portfolios, suggesting that nonlinearities and interactions do not appear substantial in the data. We also find that index trading due to financialization drives the excess comovement among commodity futures. The second essay identifies a trend factor in commodity futures markets that exploits the short-, intermediate-, and long-run moving averages of settlement price in commodity futures markets. The trend factor generates statistically and economically large returns during the sample period 2004-2019. It beats the popular momentum factor by more than five times the Sharpe ratio and less downside risk. The trend factor cannot be explained by existing factor models and is priced cross-sectionally. Then we discover that the trend factor can be explained by funding liquidity measured by TED spread. Overall, the results indicate that there are significant economic benefits from using the information on historical prices in commodity futures markets. The third essay examines how the tournament-like progression in the CEO labor market influences corporate innovation strategies. By exploiting a text-based proxy for product innovation based on product descriptions from 10-Ks, we find that industry tournament incentives (ITIs) positively affect product innovation. We then explore the trade-off effects of ITIs on product innovation created through long-term patenting technologies and short-term ""routine"" product development. We discover that ITIs strengthen routine product development activities but decrease patent-based innovation.",
"Forecasting Most Valuable Players of the National Basketball Association","McCorey, Jordan",2021,"This thesis aims at developing models that would accurately forecast the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the National Basketball Association (NBA). R programming language was used in this study to implement different techniques, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Linear Regression Models (LRM). NBA statistics were extracted from all of the past MVP recipients and the top five runner-up MVP candidates from the last ten seasons (2009-2019). The objective is to forecast the Point Total Ratio (PTR) for MVP during the regular season. Seven different underlying models were created and applied to the three techniques in order to produce potential outputs for the 2018-19 season. The best models were then selected and optimized to form the MVP forecasting algorithm, which was validated by predicting the MVP of the 2019-20 season. Ultimately, two underlying models were most robust under the LRM framework, which is considered the champion approach. As a result, two combination models were constructed based on the champion approach and proved to be most efficient. The two finalized combination models then served as the forecasting algorithm used to predict players PTR. Using this algorithm, one of the top players in PTR will win the MVP award for the regular season of the NBA. Hence, this proposed algorithm can be used post All-Star selections to determine the Most Valuable Player.",
"Foreign Cash Holdings and the Investment and Payout Response of U.S. Multinational Corporations to Provisions of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Of 2017","Sofsky, William",2021,"The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) provides a unique context in which to examine the effects of U.S. taxation of foreign earnings on the behavior of multi-national corporations (MNCs). Prior to the TCJA, the U.S. levied corporate income tax on an MNC’s worldwide earnings, deferred until firms repatriated the funds to U.S. The worldwide taxation and deferral until repatriation led to firms holding significant amounts of cash offshore. By 2017, there was an estimated $2.8 trillion of repatriatable funds ""trapped"" offshore. Prior legislation intended to encourage repatriation offered temporary ""tax holiday"" measures. The TCJA lowered corporate tax rates for all firms and eliminated future U.S. tax on repatriated earnings after payment of a one-time transition tax, creating a ""permanent tax holiday"" for foreign earnings. I examine the relationship between foreign cash holdings disclosed by MNCs in their fiscal year 2017 financial reports and their shareholder payout and investment behavior in the two years immediately following enactment of the TCJA. Similar to research into the effects of the temporary tax holidays in prior legislation, I find share repurchases in the post-TCJA period are associated with pre-TCJA foreign cash holdings. I further find that research and development and capital expenditures increase in the second year following the TCJA. These findings indicate that the foreign earnings provisions of the TCJA may have had some longer-term effects in line with its legislative intent. This contrasts with the findings of prior research and should be of interest to policymakers, particularly as the current administration considers changes to the corporate tax regime, while providing a basis for future research.",
"Founder Social Identity As A Predictor Of Customer And Competitor Orientation In Small And Medium-Sized Enterprises","Rutherford, Austin",2021,"This dissertation explores the association between Founder Social Identity and the twoleading component measures of market orientation: customer and competitor orientation. Using the typology of entrepreneurial identities developed by Fauchart and Gruber, this study empirically examines how the degree by which individuals are driven by social motivations captured by the darwinian, communitarian, and missionary founder social identity types predicts the degree by which entrepreneurs enact a customer and competitor orientation. To test this, data was collected from 492 entrepreneurs of small to medium size enterprises across all industries. Results suggest that the social motivations captured by the darwinian founder social identity type are positively related to customer and competitor orientation, the social motivations captured by the communitarian founder social identity type are positively related to competitor orientation, and that the degree to which an individual aligns with the missionary founder social identity type is positively related to customer orientation. These findings extend prior literature suggesting that the social motivations that drive entrepreneurship impact business processes and outcomes by demonstrating their link to key marketing activities.",
"Freeform Optical Surface Form Metrology with Serial Data Acquisition","Noste, Todd",2021,"Freeform optics, or optics with no axis of rotational invariance, provide optical designers more degrees of freedom, flexibility, and opportunity for innovation increasing optical performance and system integration while decreasing the form factor. Advancements in optical fabrication have enabled freeform surface manufacture with greater precision. Metrology instruments and techniques are needed to verify the performance of freeform optical surfaces and systems to keep up with design and manufacture. Freeform optics often have high slopes, no axis of symmetry, and a large departure from spherical, making traditional metrology techniques inadequate. This research was conducted to enable form measurements of freeform mirrors in the 250 mm class for a next generation three mirror anastigmatic (TMA) telescope complete with a statement of the measurement uncertainty to fill the gap in metrology of freeform optics. A flexible metrology instrument that could measure relatively large optics with customizable probe paths and sampling strategies was needed while maintaining the required uncertainty. Measurements were made using a Moore Nanotech 100UMM 4-axis coordinate measurement machine (CMM) with a probe path that allows for estimation of the thermal error and the possibility of compensation. A mathematical model was developed for the 100UMM using transformation matrices populated with the part and probe position vectors, probe displacement, machine carriage positions, geometric machine errors and probing errors. The model is used in geometric error compensation and a Monte Carlo simulation used for evaluating the task specific uncertainty. The geometric machine errors were measured for error compensation and the uncertainty in those measurements was used in the Monte Carlo simulation for task specific uncertainty evaluation of parts measured on the 100UMM. The mathematical model is also used to solve for the machine carriage positions to automate writing the machine language (g-code) for programming the probe path. A chromatic confocal optical probe was used to measure the reflective freeform optics. The Precitec chromatic confocal probe used is non-contact, has a large angle of acceptance, a 4.5 mm working distance and a 300 µm range. Initially, a point by point measurement strategy was used. To reduce overall measurement time for point to point measurements, the probe path was chosen using the traveling salesman approach. The traveling salesman problem (TSP) uses an algorithm to reduce the total distance traveled during the measurement in 3D space. Thermal characteristics of the 100UMM were evaluated using drift tests and temperature measurements. Drift tests are used to evaluate the amount of correlation between temperature and probe displacement. An environmentally controlled enclosure was installed around the 100UMM to stabilize the temperature of the ambient air, the high-pressure air going to the air bearings and the hydraulic oil for the hydrostatic bearings. The enclosure is designed to hold the metrology loop at 20 °C +/- 0.1 °C. Despite housing the 100UMM in an environmentally controlled enclosure, thermal error estimation and correction was necessary. Through probe path optimization and planning, thermal drift was estimated and corrected while the measurement time was reduced further decreasing the thermal drift. Limiting carriage movement while recording measurement data reduces the amount of thermal drift due to moving heat sources from the hydrostatic bearings and the drive motors on the carriages. The measurement time was reduced by a considerable amount by changing from a point by point measurement mode to a scanning measurement mode. By reducing measurement time, time varying errors including thermal error contributions are also reduced. The scanning mode, where the probe is moved over the surface of the part while recording the probe displacement, requires reading the machine scales directly and syncing the data acquisition of the probe displacement and machine carriage positions. The inability to sync the machine carriage positions and probe displacement at precisely the same time results in data age uncertainty. The data age uncertainty is reduced by limiting the carriage velocity, and number of carriages moving simultaneously. According to the guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (GUM) a measurement is not complete without a statement of uncertainty. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to evaluate the task specific uncertainty of parts measured on the CMM. The Monte Carlo simulation utilizes the mathematical machine model populated with the uncertainty in the machine and probe error measurements used for error compensation to evaluate the uncertainty in the best estimate of the surface being measured and specified measurands. To validate the metrology instrument and process, two half scale mirrors of third (tertiary) mirror in the AFRL TMA telescope was measured many times and in multiple setups for repeatability and reproducibility. The measurement result and statement of uncertainty were compared with the prescription and tolerances for acceptance. A spherical mirror made of glass was measured on a Fizeau interferometer and the 100UMM for a comparison of the measurement results after error compensation.",
"Fundamentals of Solar Cells and Advancements in Copper Contacts","Grempels, Sarah",2021,"Almost all energy on Earth comes from the sun. Plants use it for photosynthesis, producing nourishment for animals and essentially humans, who not only need the sun for food but also warmth. The sun is sustainable and inexhaustible, making it a renewable energy source. Solar Cells are photovoltaic devices, which harness the light given off by the sun and directly convert it into electricity. They are made up of P-N junctions from semiconductor materials. This material is able to absorb photons given off by the sunlight, which in turn raises an electron in the material to a higher energy state. This electron moves into a exterior circuit, in which its energy dissipates and is harnessed. The electron then returns to the solar cell and the process repeats. This thesis fundamentally establishes an understanding of a solar cell. The characterization of a solar cell through open circuit voltage, short circuit current, and fill factor are determined. These factors are how efficiency is calculated and how different designs are evaluated. Focus is set on improving front metallization designs of solar cells. Griddler 2.5 is used to simulate different design and compare their resulting numerical analysis. These designs focus on increasing efficiency and decreasing the amount of metal per unit cell. Uneven/even busbars are compared, as well as tapered fingers/uniform fingers with decreasing widths. Finally, experimental data of replacing the traditional screen-printing Silver paste with atmospheric Copper paste is discussed. The challenges of utilizing Cu due to oxidation, diffusion and degradation are overcome and the results show proof of successful contact between the Cu paste and the semiconductor material.",
"Generative Machine Learning Models for Airflow Prediction of Architectural Spaces","Claudio Rodriguez, Fernando",2021,"Computer Fluid Dynamics (CFD) airflow simulations are not used as often in architectural settings primarily due to time constraints. The proper use of CFD airflow simulations involves a complex setup and run-time process that requires a large amount of expertise on the different stages. This study aims to apply existing generative machine learning algorithms to compute CFD wind velocity simulations to significantly shorter run times while maintaining a relatively high accuracy level. In order to test the proposed hypothesis that machine learning can be used as a method to produce rapid and acceptable results for airflow CFD simulations in the early design stages, multiple machine learning models were created, trained, and tested. The evaluation metrics consisted of using different image similarity methods to evaluate the accuracy of the images produced by the machine learning model compared to their CFD engine counterparts. In addition, run times between the CFD engine and the trained machine learning model were recorded and compared. These results obtained indicate that GAN application for CFD airflow predictions can produce acceptable results showing a significant run time difference of over a minute between the CFD simulation and the machine learning model.",
"Geospatial and Demographic Analysis of Right-Leaning Extremist Ideological Groups: Re-Evaluating Preconceived Notions","Akin, Shelleen",2021,"The growth of right-leaning ideological extremist groups during the 2012, 2016, and 2020 political election cycles emphasizes the need to re-evaluate our preconceived notions about the demographics of groups composition and geographical information about group location. The antiquated perceptions portrayed by media and public perception characterize these members as having lower educational attainment, middle-class to lower-class socioeconomic status, exclusively living in rural areas of Republican-led states, and Caucasian as their primary race. This study reviews scholarly literature associated with right-wing ideologies to examine the realities of right-leaning extremist ideological groups. Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) Hate Group frequencies and location data, Massachusetts Institute of Technology voting data, and United States Department of Commerce Census Bureau census data were used to examine relationships between right-leaning extremist ideological group locations in California and Georgia and demographic variables associated with right-leaning extremist ideological group stereotypes. While some demographic characteristics supported portions of the stereotypes, the qualitative and quantitative analysis found that much of the data indicates further investigation is necessary to define the modern-day right-leaning extremist ideological group characteristics more accurately.",
"Historical Consciousness and Collective Identity Formation in the Kings Mountain Historical Museum","Mileski, Julia",2021,"Many studies have been completed on historical consciousness in museum visitors of all ages, however, the topic of collective historical consciousness as compared to the potential of a collective current identity in small, rural history museums lack the same exploration. The Kings Mountain Historical Museum is a local history museum and nonprofit corporation created to honor the history and ‘edu-tain’ the small, rural community of Kings Mountain, North Carolina.In these small towns, there is such a powerful and extensive sense of community, and the ways in which residents understand and connect to their own histories is of particular importance and interest as a model for other small museums. Through electronic and paper mail surveys to visitors and patrons of the museum, I have attempted to understand levels of historical consciousness and collective identity development amongst Kings Mountain Historical Museum visitors, and the formation of a place attachment and general placemaking. Survey questions were formatted with response options that generally provide positive, negative, or neutral information about the subject matter, and the survey concluded in two short-response style questions specifically included for respondents to provide voluntary additional information relevant to the museum and other questions in the survey. The results from my survey and the short-response questions showed that the Kings Mountain Historical Museum is successful in promoting a collective identity amongst Kings Mountain community members, positively influences placemaking and place attachment for the community, and promotes historical consciousness amongst visitors. Additionally, the museum is successful in educating and engaging visitors both with new information and by affirming prior knowledge, and positive correlations between length of residency and frequency of visits and higher levels of historical consciousness. Future direction for the museum should involve the engagement of the minority populations in Kings Mountain. The survey results have the potential to catalyze conversations between small museums and the communities they represent, and spur the development of additional programming, volunteer engagement, and education initiatives.",
"How Do the Homeless Newly Diagnosed With Cancer Receive Safe and Cost-Effective HealthCare Year One Following Diagnosis?","Edinger, Amy",2021,"ABSTRACTAMY B. EDINGER. How Do the Homeless Newly Diagnosed with Cancer Receive Safe and Cost-Effective Healthcare During Year One Following Diagnosis? (Under the direction of DR. STEPHANIE WOODS) Cancer is one of the most common causes of mortality in homeless adults. When a homeless person is hospitalized, they typically return to the streets, making recovery difficult. Conducting a needs assessment survey of homeless patients who are newly diagnosed with cancer was the first step towards evaluating how they can receive safe and cost-effective healthcare. Collection of information was from three perspectives: the patient, the oncology provider, and costs. Nine qualitative interviews with homeless individuals focused on concerns and barriers to care. Ten qualitative interviews with Medical Oncologists as well as a 20 question Survey Monkey was sent to all providers and focused on current treatment of their homeless patients. Lastly, a retrospective cost analysis examined costs of inpatient and outpatient care during chemotherapy. Two themes emerged from the patient interviews: Barriers to care and Someone to help. During oncology interviews, three themes were identified: I worry about everything, Making decisions, and Care after chemotherapy. Half of the 19 providers who responded to the survey monkey questions indicated that they would revise treatment plans because of homelessness. All providers stated they would utilize a Housing First option if available for their homeless patients. The retrospective cost analysis of 53 homeless patients with cancer over a 5-year period showed cost savings from inpatient vs outpatient treatment totaled $9.0 million dollars. Drawing up a proposal to share with stakeholders is needed to develop a plan to help this population which may include a Housing First/respite home as a solution.",
"How Does Family Firm Status Moderate the Relationship Between Organizational Readiness for Change and Organizational Resilience in Times of Crisis?","Castillo, Nubia",2021,"ABSTRACTNUBIA A. CASTILLO DE VALLE. How does family firm status moderate the relationship between organizational readiness for change and organizational resilience in times of crisis? (Under the direction of DR.TORSTEN M. PIEPER)The literature on organizational resilience shows that there has been little research about organizational resilience drivers. This study has two objectives. The first one aims to empirically explore if organizational readiness for change, precisely the three dimensions of organizational readiness for change: appropriateness, management support, and change efficacy (Holt, Armenakis, Feild, & Harris, 2007), as determinants of organizational resilience. The second objective investigates how firms’ structure moderates that relationship in the context of change (adoption or usage of technology) in times of COVID-19. SMART-PLS, a statistical technique popular in business and social science, was used to perform the statistical analysis of this research. PLS-SEM measurement model was utilized, and the result suggests that psychometrics scales are reliable and evidence of rational validity. This study will influence organizational resilience research, and it will inform managers practitioners on how to prepare for a catastrophe and build resilient firms. The data was sourced via a survey by Qualtrics for a total sample of 160 companies divided into 80 family firms and 80 non-family firms. The target responders were leaders of those organizations. As this is an empirical cross-sectional study, causality is not inferred and cannot be generalized; furthermore, appropriateness and family firm status (moderation) were not significant. The findings suggest that the three dimensions of organizational readiness for change (appropriateness, management support, and change efficacy) could be critical antecedents of organizational resilience. Keywords: PLS-SEM, Organizational resilience, COVID-19, Firm Structure, Organizational readiness for change.",
"How High School Location Affects Your Odds to Make it to the NBA","Chopra, Rajat",2021,"Some states or metropolitan statistical areas produce more professional athletes when compared to their representation in the population whereas some areas produce less than their represented population. Figure 1 shows the geographical distribution during the 2014-15 season for the number of active NBA players born in each state compared to the number of active NBA players who went to high school in each state in the United States. Figure 3 also supports my assumption that the parents of the athletes move or send their children to schools in favorable locations during one’s formative years to help their child accomplish higher levels in professional sports. In this study, I assess whether factors related to where an athlete went to high school and the characteristics of the city where they went to high school influence their likelihood of playing professional basketball. I am going to test for a high-school-location bias towards income, education, and poverty levels for a particular metropolitan area. The findings of this paper will help me determine that location of a high school has a positive effect on the likelihood of making it to the NBA due to the environmental factors of the metropolitan area that set an athlete up for success during their formative years.",
"How Intercollegiate Athletics Contributes to Institutional Viability and Culture: Small Private College Presidents’ Perspectives.","Simmons, Connie",2021,"Small, private colleges provide an essential element to the landscape of higher education, offering intimate class sizes and high touch experiences for traditional college populations. Led by an institutional president, who sets strategic initiatives, while working with senior-level staff and faculty to accomplish mission, the president of a small, private college must wear many hats, both to the internal campus and external community. Presidents set the tone for leadership and communication, devise strategic plans and select staff to accomplish those initiatives. With fewer layers of administration, the president of a small, private college also has greater influence on day-to-day operations than their counterparts at larger institutions. Athletics at the small, private college is an important component for enrollment, campus life, and budget. At institutions that do not provide athletic scholarship money, student-athletes account for significant portion of undergraduate populations. NCAA Division III institutions, mostly small, private colleges, incorporate athletics into campus life and position the student before the athlete. The presidents of these institutions are poised to thoroughly understand how athletics influences the viability and culture of the small, private college landscape. This research was designed as a multiple case study, examining five presidents of small, private colleges. Each president served as a case, and research was conducted through two semi-structured interviews and document collection. Interview transcripts and documents were analyzed as case study reports were devised for each case. Following individual case analysis, cross-case analysis occurred where three overlapping themes emerged: the president’s influence over managing tension with faculty, winning builds a foundation for success, and agility is necessary to respond to changes. The implications of the research project demonstrated that small, private college presidents must make decisions about athletics in alignment with institutional missions and the strategic plan, allowing a strong connection to the organization’s culture.",
"I'm gonna tell you that we're not a myth"": Native students' and non-Native teachers' perspectives on anti-Indigenous curriculum and classrooms","Hunt, Brittany",2021,"Though North Carolina is home to the 9th largest Indigenous population in America, as well as to the largest Tribe East of the Mississippi, North Carolina curriculum and schools often erode Indigenous histories from the classroom. Indigenous people are presented as forever constrained within antiquity, as savage, as docile, as stoic, and at worst – as nonexistent. This study centers Native students who traverse through these systems that perpetuate stereotypes of Indigenous barbarism, passivity, and erasure, with a focus on Native students living in urban areas of North Carolina. Similarly, non-Native teachers were interviewed for this study to discuss their role in this system as well as what they are doing to challenge it. Themes include problematic curriculum, anti-Indigeneity, erasure, White supremacy, and resistance and resilience.",
"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Families of Young Exceptional Children","Haines, Sarah",2021,"Families of young exceptional children (young children with identified delays or disabilities) have different life experiences, characteristics, and stressors than families of typically developing children. This makes the study of these families, and especially their responses to disaster, unique. This study used an online survey to investigate parents perceptions of stress and service delivery, as well as related characteristics. Across 6 participants, 100% reported increased parental stress, mostly attributed to disruptions or inconsistencies in services, impacting daily routines, schedules, and activities of families. Other results are mixed, indicating the diversity of family experiences across demographics, as well as the need for further research to inform recovery efforts. Finally, the author contends that there must be planning, by systems, schools, and teachers, for the next such disaster.",
"Impacts of Light Rail Investment on Commercial Landscapes in Transit Neighborhoods","Shepard, Elina",2021,"City governments across the country invest in rail transit to provide localized access to vital facilities for vulnerable groups of their populations, and to encourage development around transit lines and stations (Transit Oriented Development). Such developments however might pose a risk for smaller independently run businesses that could be unable to compete when saddled with increasing rent premiums, or culturally fit in with an influx of new residents. Such a phenomenon is often referred to as transit induced commercial gentrification. The main question addressed in this dissertation is what kind of changes do newly constructed light rail stations create for the existing local commercial environment? This question is addressed through analyses of three US cities that constructed their first light rail lines at approximately the same time, experienced similar influxes of new residents, and experienced similar economic growth patterns: Charlotte, NC, Phoenix, AZ, and Seattle, WA. A mixed qualitative and quantitative research design was adopted to gain a more comprehensive understanding of transit retail developments. The results of the study illustrate that commercial development around transit is sensitive to the local geographic context but the results are also consistent with existing empirical evidence and retail location theories. Results reveal some evidence of an increase in creative-cultural establishments such as art galleries around TODs in each of the three cities. Overall, however, the location of the light rail did not play a significant role in inducing a higher risk of retail establishments leaving when located in close proximity to transit stations as compared to similar locations elsewhere in the metropolitan area. Rather, the age and size of the establishment were significant indicators. Nonetheless, interviews with small business owners in new transit locations revealed more challenges than opportunities associated with their location. The results of the study are important for informing policies as cities investing in light rail should consider budgeting for the unintended consequences for local businesses.",
"Implementation and Evaluation of Optical and Stylus Based Profiling Techniques for Surface Metrology","Arumugam, Kumar",2021,"A unifying theme of this thesis is the implementation and characterization of point probes for surface metrology. The implementations include two optical non-contact profiling methods; fiber-based Fabry-Perot interferometry, and confocal microscopy. And a stylus profilometer is metrologically characterized to evaluate its suitability in measuring form of optically smooth surfaces.Fiber-based Fabry-Perot interferometers are typically used to measure displacement in confined spaces. Even though this technique is suitable for measuring surface texture, literature describing its implementation and limitations in its use as a surface profiler are scarce. Therefore, this work attempts to understand the issues with experimental implementation of this technique and the limitations of using a bare fiber probe tip for surface profiling. As outcomes of this part of the research, experimental setup is built and the feasibility in surface height measurements is validated by measuring two sinusoidal reference surfaces with heights of 1 μm and 1.5 μm and wavelengths of 100 μm and 50 μm, respectively. The second part of this thesis is to implement a flexure-based oscillation of an objective lens stack used for confocal microscopy to determine a localized surface height. Current practices include the oscillation of the surface sample, oscillation of the casing that houses the objective lens stack, and MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) based scanners. The first two approaches limit the achievable bandwidth of oscillation due to the mass of the objects being oscillated, and the latter approach is expensive. Using a flexure mechanism to oscillate the optical lens elements has the potential to increase the bandwidth of oscillation and therefore surface scanning speeds. Since the spot size produced by the objective lens determines the spatial resolution of the measurement, spot size is measured for 40X and 60X commercial objective lenses illuminated by laser and mLED (micro-Light Emitting Diode) light sources. A sinusoidal reference sample is designed and manufactured, which is later measured using a confocal microscope prototype built using a 60X objective lens. A flexure to house the lens stack to provide a surface height scanning range of 10 μm is also designed and fabricated. The third part of this thesis involves characterizing a stylus-based contact profiler for measuring areal form of freeform optics. Typically, for non-contact point probes, the optical axis must be orthogonal to the curvature of the part being measured (probe normal) to reduce errors in the measurement. Additional carriages are required to generate a probe normal scanning path. For many freeform optics, interferometric surface measurement techniques such as Fizeau interferometry requires generating a reference surface for each design prescription. Since the stylus profilers do not have these disadvantages, a commercial stylus profiler (Mahr LD260) is characterized by measuring reference objects such as optical flats, prisms, and spheres. The measurement results are compared with the measurements of these reference objects using a Fizeau interferometer. As a result, the vertical error of the X scanning carriage, side loading on the stylus probe due to the surface slope of the part being measured, and other carriage errors are estimated. A geometrical model of the system including the errors in the motion of carriages is developed, and a Monte Carlo simulation is performed to evaluate the uncertainty in the areal form measurements. The simulation resulted in a measurement uncertainty of less than 200 nm PV for a 100 mm measurement aperture.",
"Improved Bounds on a Combinatorial Problem","Page, Jacob",2021,"In this paper, we will define a function $H:\N \rightarrow \N$, whose output is the size of an optimized hypergraph based upon the restraints given by its input values.

Here, we will use properties of pre-ordered sets to define an improved lower bound for $H$.",
"Improvement of Optical and Pressure sensing capabilities of the UNC Charlotte Hypersonic Wind Tunnel","White, Michael",2021,"The UNC Charlotte hypersonic wind tunnel was designed and made by a team of engineering students in 2019. The wind tunnel is capable of holding 1500 PSI and sending air through a test chamber with viewing windows at Mach 3 and 5. The construction of the wind tunnel and confirmation of the wind tunnel’s performance were great feats achieved by the Hypersonic Senior Design team but further sensing capabilities on the wind tunnel are essential to the usefulness of the wind tunnel as a learning and research tool. A z-type schlieren system that uses refraction of light to view relative pressure differences through the center of the viewing window on the test chamber has been designed, fabricated and tested. This optical, qualitative measurement system will allow students and researchers to visualize boundary layer phenomena that occur around models under Mach 3 and 5 wind speeds. A linear actuated pressure sensing system that utilizes a pitot tube and pressure transmitters has been designed to be secured to the sidewall of the test chamber. This pressure sensing system sweeps a pitot tube back and forth through the center of the air flow in the test chamber providing continuous static and dynamic pressure readings during wind tunnel operation. The pressure sensing system provides the user with crucial information on the wind tunnel’s flow uniformity across the cross-section of the air flow as well as the true diameter of air flow traveling through the test chamber. The testing of the schlieren system has displayed phenomenal results as a stand-alone optical system and some room for improvement as an imaging system while the wind tunnel is operational. The testing with the pressure sensing system has shown quality measurement results, however the support system has proven to interrupt the flow through the test chamber. These sensing capabilities will, if nothing else, expose students to high-level wind tunnel observation providing them with experiences they can use in the real world; however, both can be used in the hypersonic field of research as they stand.",
"Improving Improv: Effects of Interpersonal Coordination on Music Improvisation","Williams, Tevin",2021,"Previous research has shown that rigidity in interpersonal coordination (too muchalignment) is negatively associated with creativity as measured by ratings of aesthetic appeal. In this study, we examine the signatures of music improvisation following a targeted manipulation involving a mirroring task. In 18 pairs, participants completed a series of tasks: a solo music improvisation performance using a percussion instrument (cajón), a mirroring task with a partner, and joint music improvisation. Across pairs, we manipulated three different types of mirroring to examine its effects on coordination during joint music improvisation. A third of the pairs engaged in Hierarchical mirroring, with partner A leading the movement and partner B following. Another third of the pairs engaged in Turn-Taking during mirroring, with partner A leading the first half of this phase and partner B leading the latter half. The final third of the pairs engaged in Egalitarian mirroring, with partners co-creating spontaneous movement together. Partners were video and audio recorded during this phase. From these recordings, we have extracted signatures of interpersonal coordination in terms of acoustic properties of the performance, using cross-correlation. We predicted that the mirroring conditions involving more rigidity (i.e., more asymmetrical roles) would be associated with more rigidity (i.e., more alignment) during music improvisation. Specifically, We predicted that the opportunity to take the lead during motor mirroring would impact coordination during improvisation as follows: pairs in which both partners had the opportunity to lead (i.e., in Turn-Taking) or co-lead (i.e., in Egalitarian mirroring) would exhibit higher behavioral complementarity (less alignment) compared to those pairs in which one partner had solely taken the lead (i.e., the Hierarchical mirroring). Measures assessing individual differences in music sophistication, personality, and prosocial orientation were also collected. Regression models with cross-correlation metrics as outcome measures displayed marginally significant differences between the Turn-Taking and Egalitarian mirroring conditions with the Turn-Taking condition displaying lower levels of cross-correlation. Regression models were also built with individual differences measures as covariates suggesting that musical ability may influence music improvisation. However, a study with a large sample size will allow for a more accurate assessment of the impact of partners’ movement patterns in a subsequent performance, thus providing theoretical insights about improvisation and collaboration.",
"Improving Nursing Recognition and Management of Postoperative Delirium in the Acute Care Setting","Belin, Latasia",2021,"Introduction: Postoperative delirium is a common cognitive complication characterized by an abrupt disturbance in brain function after surgery. It occurs in 15 to 25% of patients undergoing major elective surgeries and up to 50% of patients who have had high-risk procedures such as cardiac surgery or hip fracture repair. Postoperative delirium can result in negative outcomes such as increased healthcare costs, increased length of stay, and lasting cognitive impairment. Although nurses play a critical role in recognizing delirium, the complication remains under-recognized and poorly managed. This finding emphasizes the need for improved delirium recognition and management strategies; therefore, educational initiatives designed to improve delirium care are necessary for nurses caring for patients with this complication. Objectives: This project evaluated the effect of structured delirium education on nursing knowledge, recognition, and management of delirium. Methods: This quality-improvement project utilized the Nurses’ Delirium Knowledge Assessment (NDKA) tool, a 36-item scale divided into three subscales, to evaluate medical-surgical nurses’ knowledge before and immediately following the implementation of an on-demand web-based delirium education module. It was available to nurses from October 2020 through December 2020. Participation in this project was voluntary and consisted of nurses working on two surgical units. Assessment scores were evaluated pre-and post-education and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to detect significant changes. Results: Sixteen nurses participated in the project. Overall mean scores improved from 67.99% on the pre-assessment to 81.84% on the post-assessment. Subscale mean scores also improved and were as follows: knowledge of assessment tools and scales 71.84% pre and 87.5% post, general knowledge of delirium 75.89% pre and 85.71% post, and risk factors for delirium 56.25% pre and 72.32% post. Conclusion: The educational intervention provided in this project increased nurses’ knowledge and recognition of delirium, validating similar findings in the literature. An educational intervention delivered via electronic format is an effective method to provide delirium education to nurses. Improving nursing knowledge of delirium is essential in improving patient outcomes.",
"Improving Provider Compliance with Outpatient Heart Failure Prescribing","Sossoman , Leslie",2021,"Guidelines recommend prescribing four classifications of medications for individuals with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Individuals on guideline directed medical therapy (GDMT) have been shown to have reduced mortality and morbidity. If all eligible individuals were on GDMT, lives saved could be improved by 60% annually. The largest impact comes from prescribing GDMT with the lowest prescribing rates. Further evidence has confirmed there is a lack of guideline adherence in outpatient prescribing. Use of provider reminders with decision support improves adherence to guidelines. Study Objectives: Determine the prescribing behaviors of advanced practice providers (APPs) and physicians before and after implementation of a provider reminder tool that offers decision support in outpatient prescribing. Methods: This scholarly project occurred over two months in the fall of 2020. Eligibility criteria to have reminders placed in the chart included adults with HFrEF with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40%, seen by an APP or physician in an outpatient cardiology practice. When patients were seen in the office for their scheduled visit, providers had access to their electronic medical record (EMR) with the reminder tool sent as a provider communication note for all visit types. An additional paper reminder tool was handed to the provider for in-person visits. Following patient visits, prescribed medications were recorded to allow for pre-post comparisons. Analysis included descriptive statistics and McNemar’s test for paired nominal data using StataCorp v.16 statistical software (2019). Subgroup analysis was performed by provider type and visit type. Results: A convenience sample of 120 consecutive provider-patient encounters was evaluated in a southeastern United States outpatient cardiology practice. Compliance with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, beta blockers (BB), and hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate (H-ISDN) were numerically improved, though not statistically significant. Compliance to aldosterone antagonists (MRA) showed significant improvement after the intervention for all patients (35.8% to 41.7%, p=.020), which continued after adjusting for contraindications by medication classification. Post intervention prescribing was improved in all visit types for all medication classes except RAAS inhibitors, beta blockers, and H-ISDN in virtual visit formats. Visit type influenced prescribing of RAAS inhibitors and MRAs. In-person RAAS inhibitor and MRA prescribing had significant improvement after the intervention (78.3% to 95.7%, p = .0455; 39.1% to 56.5%, p =.0455, respectively). Improvement in prescribing was noted for APPs and physicians, except for beta blockers among physicians. Subgroup analysis of provider type did not yield any statistical difference. Uptitration of medications were numerically increased for beta blockers and RASS inhibitors. Uptitration was significantly higher in heart failure providers for RAAS inhibitors as compared to non-heart failure providers (29%; 6.5%, p=.004). The opposite was true for beta blockers, with non-heart failure providers uptitrating more (19.2%), but it was not statistically significant. Conclusions: This scholarly project demonstrated that an electronically delivered, paper generated provider reminder tool with decision support can clinically impact guideline adherence. With in-person visit type, the tool was statistically impactful. These findings are consistent with the literature. Given the uptake in the frequency of virtual visits following the coronavirus disease pandemic, virtual visit type reduced initiation of RAAS inhibitors and beta blockers, which require vital sign data. Provider type did not impact guideline prescribing. Being a HF specialist positively impacted uptitration.",
"Improving Reporting Culture through Daily Safety Huddle","MacKay, Margaret",2021,"The Institute of Medicine’s report ""To Err is Human"" remains relevant two decades later: medical error is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and 40% of hospitalized children experience medical error. One obstacle to safer care is lack of error reporting. That omission denies the opportunity to learn from those events. Safety Culture describes a work environment conducive to reporting, and its properties are measurable using the Safety of Patients Survey (SOPS 1.0 TM). On a pediatric acute care unit in a children’s hospital in southeastern U. S., SOPS 1.0TM scores and error reporting missed agency benchmarks. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to improve error reporting and SOPS 1.0TM scores relative to reporting through a Safety Huddle Intervention. Marshall Ganz’s Change through Public Narrative Framework provided the theoretical design for this project: a story of self, a story of us, a story of now. The SOPS 1.0 TM was implemented before and after the six-week intervention on the project unit and a comparison unit. Monthly error reporting was tracked before and after the intervention on those same units. The 5 composites of SOPS 1.0 TM purported to measure reporting culture showed no statistically significant differences after the intervention, or between the project and comparison units. Error reporting increased after the intervention on the project unit (p=0.0121) but not the comparison unit. Of note, this quality improvement project took place during the COVid 19 pandemic, and survey results revealed a preoccupation with staffing as an overriding concern in patient safety.",
"Improving the Interprofessional Teams’ Knowledge, Confidence, and Self-Efficacy in the Care of Adult Brain Tumor Patients","McDonnell, Margaret",2021,"Purpose:The purpose of this educational project was to determine whether interprofessional team members who participate in a structured educational session demonstrate an increase in knowledge, confidence and self-efficacy in the care of adult brain tumor (ABT) patients. The aim was to evaluate baseline ABT knowledge of neuroscience registered nurses (RNs) and advanced practice providers (APPs) and to identify barriers associated with specialized educational programs. Methods: An evidence-based education program on ABT’s was developed and delivered to neuroscience interprofessional team members in a single institution in Charlotte, North Carolina. Three measurement tools were used for data collection. One tool was used to collect demographic information, one was used for a knowledge pre/post-intervention and one for the participants to rate their confidence level. RNs and APPs functioning in a neurosurgical, neurointensivist or neurohospitalist role were eligible to participate. Travel RNs were excluded. Results: Seventeen care providers participated in this project. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the demographic characteristics of the participants, belief in supplemental education, and pre/post-intervention knowledge assessment items. McNemar’s test for paired binary data and StataCorp v.16 statistical software (2019) were used. Six participants recalled prior education specific to ABTs and 94% (n=16) believed additional education would be beneficial. A statistically significant increase in correct responses from the pre-posttest was seen in one question pertaining to histological grading classification system (p=.031). The lowest response recorded on the confidence survey was regarding the APP’s level of comfort in discussing treatment plans with patients and caregivers. Implications: The results of the project created a basis for understanding neuroscience team members level of knowledge and confidence. Further study is needed to determine effective educational strategies for the neuroscience team. Keywords: brain neoplasm, clinical guidelines, specialized training",
"Jackboots, White Hoods, and the White Bible: The Fusion of the KKK, American Nazis, and Christian Identity","Wood, Joseph",2021,"During the tumultuous twentieth century, three visually and dogmatically distinct white supremacist movements came together to bring forth a mostly unified front against their common enemies—integration, miscegenation, and various elaborate fictional conspiracies. At times antagonistic to one another, by November 1979, the stage was set for the beginnings of a movement rooted in solidarity. This thesis seeks to answer how and why the early distrust between the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Movement developed, as well as how this was overcome through the near-universal adoption of a fringe, conspiracy-minded branch of Protestant Christianity. By tracing the biographies of these organizations and movements during key moments in history, this thesis will answer the question of how and when the movements prior to 2001 came together and laid the groundwork for modern, nebulous partnerships during the twenty-first century.",
"Job Entrenched, Placeholders, or Job Detached: A Person-Centered Approach to Job Embeddedness","Nau, Geoffrey",2021,"With the introduction of job embeddedness theory, research focus shifted away from the precursors of why people leave and turned attention toward why people stay. Distinct from similar constructs, such as job satisfaction and organizational commitment, job embeddedness includes community-related issues in addition to job-related issues. While existing literature has evaluated alternate ways to measure the job embeddedness construct, variable-centered approaches continue to be utilized. This approach implicitly assumes that being high or low on job embeddedness perceptions in the form of an overall composite indicates that individuals perceive each aspect and their attachment ties similarly. Thus, this study advances the job embeddedness theoretical framework by engaging in a person-centered approach. By conducting a confirmatory factor analysis, this study found that the relationship between variables and presumed underlying factors used to measure job embeddedness was best represented by a six-factor model compared to a one-, two, or three-factor model. In addition, this study conducted a latent profile analysis to examine patterns in response indicators within the sample data and found that distinct job embeddedness profiles emerged. Controlling for SDR (Socially Desirable Responding), these profiles showed unique patterns of job-based and non-job-based experiences that relate to staying on the job. Lastly, this study examined each job embeddedness profile and compared them with respect to job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and turnover intentions.",
"Knowledge extraction and analysis of medical text with particular emphasis on medical guidelines","Hematialam, Hossein",2021,"In this dissertation document, we describe the potential for Information Extraction, Information Retrieval, and Machine Learning methods to improve the process of analyzing medical texts and, in particular, Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs).We present the results of three in-depth studies consisting of dozens of experiments on finding condition-action and other conditional sentences in guideline documents. We are improving the state-of-the-art results (up to 25%) and showing for the first time the applicability of domain adaptation and transfer learning to this problem. We also present new methods for identifying inconsistencies in disagreements between medical guidelines, and for analyzing them using a combination of machine learning, information retrieval, and text mining methods. We show the need for a formal distinction between contradictions and disagreements in natural language texts to formally reason between contradictory medical guidelines. We introduce new representations for collections of guideline documents and an algorithm for comparing collections of documents. We use these to investigate conceptual distances between guidelines for the same conditions. Throughout this process, we prove the hypothesis that the difference in recommendations largely (by 69% to 86%) correlates with the differences in concepts used by the medical bodies authoring the guidelines. Finally, we show the applicability of text analysis methods to practical problems of analyzing textual information in electronic health records. We achieved 83% accuracy in matching medical records with a list of pre-defined conditions in an EHR system, resulting in clinical system support changes in one of the leading US hospitals.",
"Let's Talk About Rape: Sexual Assault in Young Adult Literature","Moore, Makayla",2021,"Sexual assault is an incredibly mature, sensitive, and disturbing topic to discuss, but it can be even harder to teach. However, by examining literature that depicts sexual assault, readers can develop empathy for the characters by understanding how trauma manifests and acknowledging that no two assaults are the same. Readers gain insight into the victim and the perpetrator and people outside the abuse, such as family and friends. This thesis explores sexual assault narratives that cover incestuous sexual assault, stranger, acquaintance, and gray rape. These narratives are told from the perspective of memoir, semi-autobiographical, and fiction—realistic and historical—to adequately provide a much-needed platform for discussing these horrific and brutal acts of violence. The literature in this thesis also provides a model for educators who want to use this literature to better inform their students about what they may face as they go through life and how their education can protect others. Learning about these texts and teaching them is how the stigma attached to sexual assault gets destroyed.",
"Low-Income Community College Student Perceptions of Faculty Interaction in Online Courses","Salanger, Carolyn",2021,"ABSTRACTCAROLYN VINAL SALANGER. Low-Income Community College Student Perceptions of Faculty Interaction in Online Courses. (Under the direction of DR. LISA R. MERRIWEATHER)The purpose of this survey design research study was to understand student perceptions of online interactions with instructors in online courses in the spring, 2020 and determine if any differences exist in perceptions presented when taking into account Pell-eligibility. This study took place at a medium-sized community college within the North Carolina Community College System. Data was obtained through an online survey. The chi square test and logistic regression were used to analyze the quantitative data. This study revealed that students in this particular term were favorable when it came to online interactions and contrary to my hypothesis, I found that a student's perceptions were not significantly influenced by their Pell status; which can be interpreted that the experiences were not vastly different for lower-income students. Qualitative analysis of open-ended survey questions found three significant themes with regard to their perceptions of the differences they experienced in online versus face-to-face interactions: response time, ""seeing"" and ""hearing"" the instructor, and instructor attributes. Implications for practice and recommendations are offered. Keywords: community college, Pell-eligibility, online instruction, faculty-student interactions",
"MATERNITY EXPERIENCE OF ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS","Day, Magin",2021,"The goal of this study was to investigate the lived experience of pregnant active duty service members (ADSMs). In-depth interviews with 30 women ADSMs in the US Air Force were conducted and the bioecological framework was used to examine emerging individual and institutional factors that influenced well-being and retention of women during pregnancy. Ten themes were identified as significantly effecting the physical and psychological health, social interactions, future career goals, and desire to remain in the military among pregnant ADSMs. Pervasive, negative stereotypes and bias surrounding pregnancy within the Air Force; the effect of leadership style; changes in job tasks; and mistrust of military medical doctors were the most common. In accordance with the bioecological framework, complex, bi-directional relationships between these factors were identified. Specifically, changes in job tasks during pregnancy simultaneously protected the physical health and well-being of both women and their unborn children while exacerbating women’s experiences of negative stereotype and bias in the workplace. Organizational factors such as career field and leadership style also influenced the degree to which stigma and bias were experienced and effected women’s health, career goals, and desire to remain in the military. Airmen in career fields such as Security Forces, Aircraft Maintenance, and Pilots were more likely to experience greater changes in job tasks during pregnancy and reported greater amounts of negative stereotypes and bias, which ultimately affected both their physical and psychological health. A traditional authoritarian leadership style was associated with reports of adverse physical, psychological, and career goal ramifications. Furthermore, effective use of pregnancy accommodations among pregnant ADSMs was complicated by current organizational practices which leave medical recommendations to the discretion of operational commanders to enact/enforce. This, in turn, left pregnant ADSMs vulnerable to negative stereotypes and bias, in particular, among those with authoritarian leaders. Finally, findings illuminated widespread mistrust of military medical doctors among pregnant ADSMs. This stemmed from experiences in which women’s physical concerns were dismissed or went unnoticed, or their personal preferences for medical care and medical providers were not heeded within the military medical system. These processes exist within the larger culture of the military in which a hierarchical power structure and efficient processes are emphasized over individualization, and physical limitations are viewed as weakness. Given these findings, recommendations for improving processes were provided. Most notably, ways for targeting the negative organizational culture around pregnancy within the military are discussed, with the goal of fostering safe and effective ways for ADSMs to remain active, productive, integral parts of their units during pregnancy.  ",
"Men of Violence","Kessler, Cory",2021,"AbstractThe Cowboy Era in American history began following the end of the Civil War in the 1860s and lasted until the 1890s when much of the Western Frontier land was privatized and sectioned off by owners with the use of barbed wire. Despite the relatively short life of this era, it spawned myths for American culture well into the 20th century. Many of these lawmen shared characteristics with the outlaws—gambling, womanizing, gunplay—which created a mirror narrative that allowed those who heard and read the narratives to identify with both the lawman and the outlaw equally. Men of Violence challenges the mythology of this era by removing the stereotypical cowboy from his original context and placing him in the modernized world of 1927 in the waning years of the Prohibition Act. The story follows retired Marshal Josiah Cane as he is drawn into one last investigation and manhunt, and challenges the prevailing cultural story that violence can be honorable.",
"Model Predictive Control on Thermal Stress Reduction for Grid-Connected Inverters Reliability Enhancement","Wang, Luocheng",2021,"Thermal stress has been identified as one of the major failure causes in the power module. It is generated from the mechanical strain by severely varying temperatures at different loci in the power module and the different coefficients of the thermal expansion of materials, where the varying temperatures result from the real-time power loss across the power converter. This thermal stress accelerates the degradation of semiconductor devices, downgrades the system quality and efficiency, and eventually causes catastrophic system breakdowns and extensive economic losses. Therefore, this research is dedicated to investigating both local control level methods and system level strategies to ameliorate the real-time power loss in order to reduce the thermal stress in the power module, thereby extend the component lifetime and enhance the system reliability.Prior work for local control level methods including the modulation method, and the control target method shows an effective progress on the power loss and thermal stress reductions. However, the increased control loops and complicated modulation schemes in the modulation method affect the system stability. The onefold feature of temperature rising and scalability issue in the control target method restrict the degree on the thermal stress reduction. Besides, prior work for system level strategies is still in its infancy, where a few of strategies are developed preliminarily to reduce the thermal stress and coordinate the power sharing method for the multiple inverters microgrid. However, these strategies are all power sharing oriented instead of being thermal stress oriented. They may present a limited adjustment on the thermal profile. In this research, novel local control level method and system level strategy are developed. First, a finite-control-set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) is introduced and deductively investigated from the local control level. Its variable switching frequency property is derived through the geometry analysis on the voltage vector space. It realizes the switching frequency variation autonomously by the loading power. By taking advantage of this property, the power loss is leveled in the real-time operation by FCS-MPC and a more mitigated thermal profile is acquired compared with the one by the conventional controller. Furthermore, an energy-loss-minimization secondary problem formulation in FCS-MPC is proposed to reduce the power loss in order to achieve the junction temperature mean value decreasing in the power module. This secondary problem formulation is integrated with the basic problem formulation by different weightings to achieve the power flow control and the power loss reduction simultaneously. Second, a centralized thermal stress oriented dispatch (TSOD) system level strategy is proposed for multiple paralleled distributed energy resource systems, which help to reduce the thermal stress in the power module of paralleled converters. It is thermal stress oriented and takes effect according to the real-time junction temperature variation, the health condition of the individual converter and the system operation. Two local control level methods, the switching frequency variation and the reactive power injection, are imported separately as the dispatch algorithm to generate the expected power loss. Dealing with the varying mission profile, the more mitigated thermal profiles are achieved for all converters with the assistance of the proposed TSOD strategy. The effectiveness of all methodologies from both local control level and system level is validated in the simulations, experiments, and Model-in-the-Loop testing. A long-time-scale analysis from the reliability assessment is also conducted to quantify the impacts of the relieved thermal stress on the damage and lifetime of the power module. Results justify the significant thermal stress reduction in the power module of the converter, which is the main contribution of this research.",
"Moderating Effect of Political Affiliation, Kinship Ties, Environmental Munificence and Environment Uncertainty in the Relationship Between Institutional Trust and Entrepreneurial Orientation.","Henriques, Tchijica",2021,"Micro-entrepreneurship constitutes undeniably an important development strategy in developing countries. Earlier empirical studies have shown it generates 20 to 45% of full-time employment and 30% to 50% of rural household income in Africa. However, when assessing employment growth through the expansion of existing microenterprises, data suggests that most small enterprises in rural Africa do not grow. This research seeks to examine the relationship between institutional trust and entrepreneurial orientation in rural Africa. The study investigates how external factors such as political connections, environmental uncertainty, munificence and kinship ties affect the relationship between institutional trust and entrepreneurial orientation. The research builds on an alternative approach to institutional theory as it relates to the African context. The research questions are addressed through both an exhaustive review and synthesis of the literature and using primary data gathered from surveys from microenterprise owners organized in cooperatives in rural communities of Angola. The data analysis tests the hypothesized relationships through ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with tests for moderation.",
"Multi-Task Generalization using Practice for Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning","Pattnaik, Upasana",2021,"Feedback driven deep reinforcement learning methodologies are widely favoured approaches to solving artificial intelligence problems. The algorithms navigate complex decision-making tasks without manual state space engineering. Notable problems considered out of reach by machines, like mastering Go, StarCraft, Dota2 and Atari 2600 games were solved successfully. However, these algorithms require extensive amounts of time and data to specialize in one problem. Transfer learning strategies approach this challenge by supplementing the reinforcement learning task with shareable knowledge from a source task. The source provides basal knowledge about the environment, thus reducing the time to learn. Additionally, these strategies can be adopted in the multi-task learning domain. This strategy favours building generalized representations capable of solving different problems simultaneously using shared representation from similar tasks as a source of inductive bias. The addition of transfer learning helps to ground the simultaneous training of different learning objectives.This thesis employs the transfer learning paradigm Practice as an auxiliary task to improve the generalization capabilities of a distributed deep reinforcement learning algorithm in the multi-task problem setting. The algorithm implements distributed learners that optimize on different task objectives and contribute to training a single representation proficient in all objectives. Experimental results indicate that Practice's addition of state dynamics information effectively improves the generalization capabilities of the algorithm. Additionally, the contributions of each learner are analyzed to study their impact on the overall multi-task learning objective.",
"Not Just for Kicks: Discipline, Self-Control, and Martial Arts Culture in America","Menear, Chad",2021,"While martial arts are becoming more and more popular in American society, very little research is done on what relationship these practices have with violence. Previous research has shown a link with Eastern martial arts and reducing levels of aggression. Meanwhile, much of the limited social theory on violence contends that modern, Western culture reduces aggression by way of placing more emphasis on self-control. This paper set out to test these contradictory ideas by comparing aggression levels and emphasis placed on self-control between different styles of Eastern and Western martial arts. The findings did not support either of these ideas. Neither emphasis on self-control nor style of martial art had a significant negative effect on levels of aggression. However, the findings were consistent with Randall Collins’ micro-sociological theory of violence.",
"Novel Control Strategies for Single-Phase Inverter Based Microgrids Considering Grid Integrated and Islanded Conditions","Bisht, Robin",2021,"This dissertation focuses on designing and developing single-phase inverter (SPIs)control typologies for different microgrid (MG) frameworks. SPIs are considered a major part of the distributed energy resources (DERs), especially at the power distribution level laterals. Thus, effective and collective management of SPIs at normal grid operating conditions and under disturbances is a critical factor for reliable and efficient operation of grid integrated DERs with SPIs. The major contribution of this dissertation is that, first, a local control architecture is designed that works for Stand-Alone (SA) and Grid-Connected (GC) modes of operation of SPI and does not require switching between control modes. The architecture also provides a seamless transfer of the SPIs from GC to SA without compromising the grid quality and confirming to interconnect on standards. Second, a control architecture for multiple inverters connected to the same phase that can share the loads is designed. This is extended to multiple inverters connected to each phase in one lateral during normal operation and under unbalance conditions. Third, an architecture that can be used for grid support function with SPIs connected at different parts of the power distribution network is designed. For this, an adaptive droop-based architecture is explored that identifies the system’s impedance matrix and can be applied for varying network topology. The approach is based on the alternate direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for identifying the grid impedance as a multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) trans. Finally, a coordinated framework is proposed for using SPIs along with legacy grid controllers to support the power distribution system. Overall the results show that the proposed control architectures perform better than the state-of-the-art and also provides grid functions that allow high penetration of SPIs in the power grid.",
"Numerical models of COVID-19","Cung, Benjamin",2021,"COVID-19 is an ongoing infectious disease where individuals progress through the following four stages: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), and recovered (R). The standard mathematical model for the spread of such diseases through a large population is a system of ordinary differential equations, called the SEIR model. However, the qualitative features of the outbreak predicted from the SEIR model do not match with what the actual course of COVID-19 is doing in the U.S. population. In this thesis, we explore several different modifications of the standard SEIR model to determine and observe whether these modifications can recreate the qualitative features of the real world data.",
"Opinion Mining and Emotion Detection in Social Network Data and Student Survey Data in Cloud Environment","Easwaran, Akshaya",2021,"Recent growth and development of big social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook,Instagram etc. and personal blog sites generate huge amount of unstructured data. Analysis of this data may provide insights into the opinion of people as well as their feelings towards certain subjects, products or services. The process of extracting valuable data from opinions of people to assess their feelings and thoughts is known as opinion mining. Mining the opinions of people has applications in several areas: understanding what people like or dislike is critical for making informed business and political decisions. In this work, we focus on Opinion Mining from Text to suggest Actionable Recommendations. The Actionable Patterns may suggest ways to alter the user's sentiment or emotion to a more positive or desirable state. We apply our method to Twitter Social Network Data, as well as Student Survey Education data. We aim to suggest ways to improve the Social Network Experience and to improve Teaching Methods and Student Learning. We implement and test our system in Scalable Environment with BigData using the Apache Spark platform.",
"Optimal Override Policy for Chemotherapy Scheduling Template via Mixed-Integer Linear Programming","Sikder, Ishtiak",2021,"Owing to treatment complexity in chemotherapy administration, nurses are usually required at the beginning, end, and at certain times during treatment to ensure high-quality infusion. It is, thus, critical for an outpatient chemotherapy unit to design a scheduling template that can effectively match nursing resources with treatment requirements. The template contains appointment slots of different lengths and thus allows schedulers to place patients into these appointment slots according to the provider’s order. As the template is often used over a period of several months, there usually exists a mismatch between the daily patient mix and the fixed structure of the given template. Hence, override policies must be employed to adjust to demand. However, these policies are often manually performed by schedulers. A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model has thus been proposed in this thesis to systematically develop optimal override policies in place of the manual process to improve template utilization while maintaining template stability. Numerical experiments based on real-life data from a chemotherapy unit are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",
"Optimism and Crowdfunding Success: The Moderating Effect of Pitch Changes on Funding Success After Initial Failures.","Carrothers, James",2021,"AbstractJAMES L. CARROTHERS. Optimism and Crowdfunding Success: The Moderating Effect of Pitch Changes on Funding Success After Initial Failures. (Under the direction of DR. JUSTIN W. WEBB)Entrepreneurs fail. Statistics on new venture failure rates show that 65% of new ventures fail during the first 10 years. Entrepreneurs are optimists as well. Little research has addressed the interaction between optimism and entrepreneurial failure. To fill this gap, my dissertation examines optimism and how founders use rhetoric to seek new opportunities after failure. Using rhetorical theory along with signaling theory and research on both optimism and change, I examined 330 failed Kickstarter campaigns using computer-aided text analysis of both the original pitch that resulted in failure and the subsequent pitch. Examining the changes in the second pitch along with selected moderators, I proposed that founders’ optimism as presented in their -second pitch would increase funding performance after initial failure in the crowdfunding campaign. Results suggest that there are several factors that affect funding performance. This dissertation makes contributions in the area of entrepreneurs’ expressed optimism in response to failure and how changes in optimistic language improve funding performance after initial failure.KEYWORDS: Optimism, Founders, Crowdfunding, Failure.",
"Optimizing the interdisciplinary team in a neuroscience ICU","Gibson, Allison",2021,"Introduction: A high-functioning interdisciplinary team is needed to achieve optimal team and patient outcomes in the provision of care for intensive care patients. The difference between a high functioning and suboptimal interdisciplinary team manifest as variations in team outputs. Identification of key characteristics of high functioning teams can be used to assess and evaluate current interdisciplinary teams for potential areas of optimization. Methods: This project is a quality improvement needs assessment of the current interdisciplinary team performance in the neuroscience intensive care unit (NSICU) at a large academic medical center. This project employed a mixed method design, using quantitative methods for collected survey data and qualitative methods for thematic analysis of open-ended responses. Results: The survey had a 59.5% response rate, with 84 team members completing the survey. The majority of participants were registered nurses (n=51), followed by medical providers (n=21), and then other therapist members (n=12). Five themes were identified from open-ended responses regarding strengths and barriers to team effectiveness: structure, roles, the rounding processes, engagement, and team interactions. Within these themes, the needs of the team included: a shared decision-making model, improved engagement of staff members, improved team stability, clearly defined roles, interventions to improve the rounding process, and further evaluation of team interactions. Discussion: Assessment and diagnosis are the first steps in approaching optimization of the interdisciplinary team. Each interdisciplinary team is unique. Understanding the needs of the team is essential to creating a high functioning team. Key words: Interdisciplinary, Multidisciplinary, Team, Quality improvement, Team processes",
"PREDICTORS OF BINGE EATING BEHAVIOR AND PERCEIVED HEALTH: SIMILARITIES BETWEEN WHITE AND BLACK COLLEGE MEN","Minnick, Alyssa",2021,"Obesity is a significant public health concern that is associated with poorer mental and physical health outcomes and approximately 41% of college men are overweight or obese. Given the impact of obesity in this population, research should focus on antecedents to obesity as well as factors that may influence treatment-seeking. Therefore, the present dissertation conducted two separate but related studies to examine predictors of binge eating behaviors and perceived health. The literature is limited on its understanding of these factors among college men, specifically those from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds; thus, both studies also examined racial differences between White and Black college men. An anonymous online survey was completed by 591 college men (383 White and 208 Black) to test hypothesized models. Structural invariance analyses indicated statistical similarities between the path coefficients of White and Black college men for both models, indicating racial similarities in correlates of binge eating and perceived health. Findings have important implications for interventions and health education efforts for college men. Additional research is warranted to clarify the findings and enhance our understanding of binge eating and perceived health among college men.",
"Parent and Adolescent Contributions to Family Hardiness in the Wake of a Natural Disaster","McMillan, Iris",2021,"Researchers have typically focused on individuals’ abilities to respond to natural disasters, while family processes post-disaster have received far less attention. Yet a family may be more than a sum of its parts and little is known about how the resilience and vulnerabilities of individual family members contribute to their overall perceptions of their families’ strength. To fill this gap, this study investigated how mothers’ and adolescents’ reports of their individual resilience and personal level of emotion dysregulation predicted their perceptions of family hardiness after experiencing an impactful natural disaster (i.e., a tornado that destroyed the adolescents’ high school). Data from a sample of 29 mother-adolescent dyads (Mage = 45.07 years and 16.66 years) were analyzed using Actor-Partner Interdependence Modelling. Results indicated that greater emotion regulation difficulties, but not individual resilience were predictive of higher levels of family hardiness among families surviving a natural disaster. Numerous problems with the family hardiness measure were uncovered suggesting the need for further conceptual, definitional, and measurement clarity for this construct. Thus, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Moreover, the mechanisms responsible for the findings of the current study remain subject for future research.",
"Perceived Work Ability for Employees with Mental Illness: The Roles of Symptom Severity, Anticipated Discrimination, and Internalized Stigma","Bardwell, Tarya",2021,"Working adults with mental illness must navigate stigma and impairment in the workplace, and these factors may affect their perceived ability to continue working in their current job. Using appraisal theory and the why try model, the current study tested for predictors (symptom severity and anticipated discrimination) of perceived work ability. Participants were recruited from Amazon’s MTurk to complete two self-report surveys, one week apart. I found that symptom severity and anticipated discrimination negatively predicted perceived work ability. Internalized stigma was not found to moderate these effects. Additionally, I found a bi-directional relationship between anticipated discrimination and symptom severity. Because direct effect hypotheses were built on the theoretical foundation of stress appraisal, a supplemental mediation analysis was included. Stress was found to partially mediate the relationships between symptom severity and perceived work ability. Results lay the groundwork for future research, including intervention studies designed to support the work ability of employees with mental illness.",
"Performance Analytics of Graph Algorithms Using Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory","Unmann, Evan",2021,"The increased size of data sets is driving the need for increased memory storage andspeed. Persistent memory, PMEM, has emerged as a new solution to the problem. It places itself in between main memory and storage in the memory hierarchy. PMEM offers the ability to increase the amount of addressable memory or the use of dynamic random access memory, DRAM, as a hardware managed cache with PMEM acting as main memory for the machine. In both cases, it becomes paramount to understand the strengths and weaknesses of PMEM. As PMEM is different hardware from DRAM, it has different performance which implies that code written for DRAM might not be optimized for PMEM. This manuscript delves into the performance metrics of PMEM to determine its effectiveness for standard graph algorithms. It also will serve as a guideline as to how to optimally use PMEM and when PMEM becomes advantageous to use. To overcome the physical storage limits of memory, solutions such as distributed computing and out-of-core computing arose. Distributed computing allows multiple nodes of a computing cluster to compute and communicate in parallel. The disadvantage of this approach becomes the communication overhead between nodes. Out-ofcore computing adds layers of slower memory closer to the node to avoid distributed computing. The additional memory typically comes in the form of hard drives or solid-state drives, SSD. Because of how programs interact with drives, code needs to be rewritten to take advantage of this approach, including accessing the memory, reordering the data in a more efficient read order, and localizing computations to minimize reading from drives. PMEM offers the first solution in which current programs can fully utilize the memory with little to no changes in code. This of-iv fers a plug-and-play solution where distributed computing and out-of-core computing cannot. This manuscript measures the performance of PMEM by running benchmarks to measure bandwidth, latency, and graph algorithm performance. Each benchmark is ran on PMEM and DRAM to compare against each other. The graphs selected for benchmarking are a combination of real-world graphs. Results shows that PMEM can be utilized to achieve performance comparable to DRAM.",
"Power Electronics Assisted Voltage Regulators for Modern Distribution Systems","Wang, Yafeng",2021,"Step voltage regulator (SVR) has been utilized in power distribution systems for decades. The induced arc from the conventional SVR tap change and the voltage instability from the renewable energy penetration impose constraints on the conventional SVRs’ lifetime. With more distributed power generation and renewable energy penetration, voltage fluctuation and power generation variation can be observed more frequently in the modern power distribution network. More tap change operations are required for SVR to regulate the line voltage. However, the tap changing mechanism of the conventional SVR always generates an electric arc when tap changes, which imposes constraints on conventional SVRs, such as lifetime and maintenance period. Meanwhile, the voltage regulation accuracy cannot be guaranteed since the SVR regulates the voltage step by step. The power electronics transformer solution was proposed but requires the power converter capacity proportional to the voltage regulation range, which significantly increases the system cost.Motivated by the issues mentioned above, several PE-assisted arcless tap change topologies are proposed to reduce the contact erosion rate of tap changers in SVR. The system efficiency is the same with the conventional SVR in normal operation, while the converter power rating is only 0.3% of the total system power, which also reduces the system cost compared with the full power electronics solutions. Based on the proposed arcless tap change mechanism, a hybrid voltage regulator is proposed. Stepless load voltage regulation is achieved while the tap changer mechanism remains in the system, which helps to promote the upgrade to the existing power distribution systems. A scaled-down prototype of the arcless SVR is developed to verify the proposed arcless tap changing method. The hardware test results verified the proposed arcless step voltage regulator can eliminate arcing during the tap change and reduce the contact erosion rate by over 10,000 times the conventional arcing SVR. Other advantages of the novel method over the conventional SVR, such as advanced load voltage regulation and volt/var control, are also verified. The proposed hybrid voltage regulator was simulated and experimentally validated. The experimental results demonstrate arcless tap change operation, stepless voltage regulation, and load voltage continuity during the tap change. For PE-based hybrid voltage regulators, many functions, such as fast voltage regulation, flicker compensation, and var control, can be accomplished, which cannot be achieved from the conventional SVR. This research also proposed a new topology of the hybrid voltage regulation transformer (VRT). The feasibility and capability of var control are investigated for different load power factors and input voltage percentage when the voltage regulation does not exceed the power converter capacity. The simulation results illustrate the feasibility of implementing var control while the load voltage is being regulated. This dissertation also proposed a new hybrid transformer based on interline power converters for voltage regulation. The maximum power delivered by converters is reduced in half compared with the conventional series compensation configuration for the same voltage regulation range. Therefore, the proposed hybrid transformer exhibits a higher overall efficiency covering a wide range of voltage regulation. Comparison between the conventional series voltage compensation method and the proposed interline power converter-based method is presented based on the operation principle, the converter power, and the overall system efficiency.",
"Putting Equity to Work: A Qualitative Case Study Exploring Teacher Candidates Perceptions on Equity and Social Justice Pedagogy in a Teacher Preparation Program","Jones-Fosu, Stephanie",2021,"For decades, White supremacy and Whitewashed teacher preparation curriculum have been used to prepare a majority White female teacher workforce. This same workforce has had limited exposure to diversity and a lack of cultural competence and critical consciousness yet is expected to teach diverse student populations. Furthermore, this curriculum is being taught by a majority of White teacher-educators, who also have limited exposure to diversity and a lack of cultural competence and critical consciousness. Additionally, teacher education programs have been under scrutiny for being ineffective when preparing teachers for the classroom because much of what a teacher candidate learns before entering the classroom is not enacted when faced with the pressures of teaching in a new environment. To combat the lack of critical consciousness, cultural competence, and effective teaching, teacher education programs have implemented equity and social justice concepts in the curriculum. Yet, teacher preparation programs have experienced tension with focusing on equity and social justice or focusing on pedagogical practices. This study seeks to explore equity and social justice in a teacher preparation program through the lived experiences of teacher candidates who are attempting to enact equity and social justice pedagogy in their teaching. Based on this study, it suggests that for a university-based teacher education program to support teacher-candidates enactment, while addressing the tension between focusing on equity and social justice or pedagogy, they must: a) identify the teacher candidates perceptions of the curriculum that addresses equity and social justice, b) identify how teacher candidates are attempting to enact equity and social justice in the classroom, and c) identify what the teacher candidates gained from the curriculum that helped them incorporate equity and social justice in the classroom. To meet this task, this study employed a constructivist approach, investigating teacher candidates’ understanding and knowledge before their teacher preparation program in addition to experiences gained during their program. Through a qualitative research design, this study applied a case study approach to reveal the teacher candidates' experiences within a teacher preparation program (TPP), who are student teaching in diverse urban schools during their last year. Through semi-structured, open-ended virtual interviews, the lived experiences of teacher candidates were gathered and analyzed using Merriam and Tisdell’s (2015) method of analysis to describe the teachers’ practices and understandings as they attempt to teach diverse students inequitable ways. The teacher candidates' perceptions of equity and social justice within their TPP were revealed as they share insights on their experiences engaging with the TPP curriculum. The purpose of this study was to explore how equity is enacted within a teacher preparation program through the perspectives of the teacher candidates. Findings suggested three themes that aligned correspondingly with each research question. When incorporating social justice and equity, teacher preparation programs need to thread equity and social justice in the curriculum in a way that is fluid and integral, treating equity and social justice like oxygen. When addressing teacher candidates, they need multiple exposures to equity, and social justice over some time, including beyond their program to grow in their identity development to enact equity and social justice, treating teacher candidates like sponges. When reflecting on teacher preparation programs supporting teachers’ enactment of equity and social justice, bold and courageous decisions must be made to dismantle the racist systems in education to work toward programs immersed with an anti-racist and social justice approach to developing teachers for diverse students, treating teacher preparation programs with boldness.",
"RENEGOTIATING IDENTITY: UNDERSTANDING THE COMMUNICATIVE NEGOTIATION OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFER STUDENT IDENTITIES","Stamper, Brandy",2021,"Literature on community college (CC) students transferring to four-year institutions sufficiently addresses aspects of pre-transfer success indicators, transfer process barriers, and post-transfer outcomes. Yet, research frameworks in post-transfer adjustment and engagement have not taken into account how identity is shaped and renegotiated by CC students. This phenomenological study explored the identity experiences of fifteen community college transfer (CCT) students one year after they transitioned to a large, public four-year institution. The purpose of the study was to understand how CCT students’ lived experiences inform their student identities. The communication theory of identity (CTI), served as the study’s theoretical framework, focusing on the manifestation of identities through communicative interactions and expressions with others. Primary data collection occurred through two rounds of semi-structured interviews with each participant. Data analysis followed a procedure of categorizing the participants' statements into meaning units that represented the layers of identity being examined. The process of data categorization, reduction, and theme identification resulted in two overarching themes, four subthemes, and 16 distinct identity manifestations. The first theme demonstrated that CCT students engage in careful and purposeful positive student identity development behaviors while in community college. The second overall theme illustrated how CCT students renegotiated their previously formed student identities at their four-year receiving institution. The study's findings provide possible student engagement and institutional-based suggestions on how to serve CCT students. The conclusions drawn from the study and their implications for theory and practice are also presented.",
"Radar Characteristics of Observed Supercell Thunderstorms Interacting with the Appalachian Mountains","McKeown, Katherine",2021,"Few studies have ventured to understand how supercell thunderstorms behave while interacting with complex terrain, though it poses a significant short-term forecasting problem. The few that have investigated this relationship tended to use small sample sizes, limited idealized simulations, or only focused on convection initiated by the terrain. This study aims to fill that gap by analyzing a large observed dataset of supercells interacting with the Appalachian Mountains. A total of 62 isolated supercells observed within the central and southern Appalachians between 2008 and 2019 were analyzed in this study. Each supercell was categorized based on the extent of their interaction with the terrain (either crossing or non-crossing); the majority (37) were classified as non-crossing, while a smaller minority (25) were classified as crossing. Analysis of storm tracks suggest that the extent of terrain effects on supercell maintenance are sensitive to the local topography. To better understand how supercells respond to variations in terrain, each supercell was tracked over its lifetime using GR2 software. Additionally, GIS was used to obtain additional information about the elevation, slope, angle of approach, and aspect. A variety of radar characteristics were collected for each of these storms, including reflectivity, velocity, maximum expected hail size (MEHS), echo tops, and mesocyclone intensity, depth and diameter. The mesocyclone parameters (depth, intensity and diameter) are the most different among crossing and non-crossing supercells. Crossing supercells typically have deeper, stronger, and wider mesocyclones. Based on the results, a list of radar-based thresholds were created to be used in operational settings.",
"Reconceptualizing the Engagement of Older Adults in the Use of Interactive Technology","Lee, Lina",2021,"A ""silver tsunami"" is on its way. Silver tsunami refers to the rapid aging of the population and, in particular, of the baby boomer generation. This demographic shift has moved the focus of researchers, designers, health care providers, and policymakers from ascertaining ways to extend the lifespan to ways to improve the quality of life. The aging population constitutes one of the most significant social transformations in the 21st century, making technology essential for the senior community to integrate with the outside world. However, the focus of recent research in designing technology for older adults lies in its usability and ability to monitor health. Despite the increasing number of studies in the field of aging and technology, there is insufficient research on understanding the practical issues of user focus, adoption, and engagement with respect to interactive technologies among older adults. In this study, we used four technological interventions (Move and Paint, Savi, uDraw, and GrandPad) that are new to older adults to stimulate and increase their initial engagement with technology use. We employed a mixed-method approach involving focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, observations, and diary study to understand the technology-related perceptions and behaviors of older adults and identify factors affecting their initial engagement with interactive technology. This study points out the lack of research on initial engagement among older adults and highlights the importance of the same in the use of new interactive technology. Our thesis statement is that initial engagement, which affects long-term engagement, is more important than need and usability and poses different challenges among older adults based on their behaviors toward interactive technology. The contributions of this study are 1) a new model for older adults’ engagement with interactive technology, 2) an active-passive spectrum of older adults’ behaviors toward interactive technology, and 3) the identification of key factors that influence the initial engagement of older adults. We present new expectations of initial engagement in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and suggest new research directions in the use of interactive technology by older adults.",

"Relationship Between Entrepreneurial Orientation and the Intention to Pursue Digital Entrepreneurship: Opportunity Evaluation in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises","Chapman, Ophelia",2021,"Over the past several years the connection between entrepreneurship and digital technologies has transformed the way business is conducted. This, coupled with reactions to the coronavirus outbreak that have caused interruptions to significant economic and business activities, has exponentially accelerated the implementation of digital technologies. Yet intentions to pursue digital entrepreneurship remain understudied, while an increasing number of small and medium-sized businesses continue the adoption of digital technologies unabated. This dissertation examines the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and intention to pursue digital entrepreneurship, and whether this relationship is moderated by opportunity evaluation. Data was gathered from entrepreneurs (N=240) through a cross-sectional survey approach, and regression analysis was used to analyze the data. A confirmatory factor analysis was also performed. The results indicate that entrepreneurial orientation is positively linked to intention to adopt digital technologies. The study found evidence of interaction effects between two opportunity evaluation constructs: loss estimation and perceived feasibility and entrepreneurial orientation. The results signal the importance of studying moderators of the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial intention to adopt digital technology.",
"Relationship Between Writing Self-Efficacy and Writing Achievement: Evidence from an Empirical Study and a Meta-Analysis","Sun, Ting",2021,"This three-article format dissertation aims to provide evidence of the effect size of the relationship between writing self-efficacy and writing achievement in an empirical study and a meta-analysis, and compare three methods, the averaging method, three-level meta-analysis (3LM), and robust variance estimation (RVE), in handling multiple dependent effect sizes within studies in doing the meta-analysis. In the first article, data were collected from college students in an English as a foreign language (EFL) context. The second article extracted 575 effect sizes from 76 primary studies, which were also used in the third article. Results revealed a medium to large observed effect size (r = .47) with EFL students and a medium true effect size (r = .29) of the relationship between writing self-efficacy and writing achievement. Writing in English as a first language (L1) or a second language (L2) was found to moderate the relationship between writing self-efficacy and writing achievement, with the effect size estimated with L2 learners (r = .44) being statistically significantly larger than that yielded with L1 learners (r = .23). Results also revealed that statistical procedure moderated effect size estimates. The third article found that while the averaging method, 3LM, and RVE yielded similar estimates of the average effect size and standard error, the averaging method resulted in a much smaller variance of true effect sizes. 3LM produced the smallest variance estimate when the number of primary studies is small. This dissertation provides evidence of the observed and true effect sizes of the relationship between writing self-efficacy and writing achievement. It also informs meta-analysts of the performance of the three methods in handling dependent effect sizes in doing meta-analyses.",
"Relationship between saprolite-hosted groundwater chemistry, baseflow, and weathering depth at Redlair Observatory, a critical zone research site on the North Carolina Piedmont","Horgan, Julianna",2021,"Crystalline bedrock weathering profiles in the southern Piedmont terrane have thicker soils and gentler slopes than mountainous terranes with their thin soils and steep slopes. The objective of this study was to understand watershed-scale baseflow and groundwater chemistry in relationship to weathering depth, and to assess landscape position (ridgetop, midslope, and base of slope) as a potential critical zone factor within the Piedmont. This study took place at the recently established (2019-present) Redlair Observatory (RO) in Gaston County, North Carolina in the southern Piedmont. RO is part of the 1,200-acre Redlair Preserve, which protects Magnolia macrophylla and Helianthus schweinitzii. The climate at RO is humid and subtropical, with a mean annual temperature of 14.5°C. The geology consists of felsic and mafic metavolcanic rocks of the Charlotte Terrane overlain by Ultisols (Cecil soil series) and Entisols (Pacolet soil series). Seventeen wells were installed among four zero-order to first-order watersheds, ~4-25 m deep. Monthly surface water baseflow sampling, seasonal groundwater sampling, high-resolution continuous loggers, and geospatial analyses were used to examine critical zone processes. Samples were analyzed for major ion concentrations and water isotopes (δD, δ18O). Groundwater ranged from -25.4 to -35.8‰ (δD) and from -4.6 to -7.9‰ (δ18O). Manual groundwater measurements and 10-minute increment loggers revealed that groundwater levels were shallowest in the late spring-early summer months and deepest in late fall-early winter months. However, not all wells responded to these warmer groundwater peaks and colder groundwater minimums on the same timeline. Water level and temperature patterns suggest that mean groundwater residence times are on the order of a season to a few months. Well depth seemed to be the most important factor influencing groundwater chemistry in this study. Most notably, the calcium/sodium (Ca/Na) molar ratios of the shallow wells versus the deep wells reveal a varying degree of weathered material at depth. The deep wells had higher Ca/Na ratios of 0.34-1.72 (5-24 m depth below land surface) while the shallow wells had Ca/Na ratios ranging from 0.7-1.79 (4-21 m depth below land surface). This suggests that the deep wells were screened in less weathered material than the shallow wells, consistent with weathering of Na-plagioclase shallower in the weathering profile and Ca-plagioclase deeper in the weathering profile. This study found that hydrologic processes occur quickly in these small (4.4-15.5 ha) headwater watersheds of the Piedmont. Understanding of critical zone processes is important for predicting how small watersheds will respond to climate change and urbanization influences. Locally, the results of this study may contribute to management of Redlair Preserve.",
"Representation Learning of Image Recognition: Diversity, Aspect Ratio, Invariance, and Composition","Chen, Qiuyu",2021,"Deep neural networks (DNN) are proved to be effective and improve the performance dramatically in various kinds of computer vision tasks. The end-to-end learning manner in training DNN consistently shows the powerful modeling ability and consequently mitigates the dedicated efforts for expert feature engineering. On the other hand, it raises the issue that how to improve the black-box network with better representation (feature) learning especially when the learned representations and classifiers are tied together in the manner of supervised learning. In this work, representation learning is studied in four perspectives of different fields, i.e. diversity in ensemble learning, aspect ratio in image aesthetics assessment, invariance in identification task, and composition in color attribute recognition.In light of analyzing the bottleneck of black-box network and designing better representation learning for target tasks, we introduce that: (a) Ensemble learning relies on the diversity of the complementary neural networks, in both feature representations and classifier representations. A diverse representation learning method, namely learning-difficulty-aware embedding, is proposed to adaptively reconcile learning attentions for different categories by training a series of networks with diversified representations sequentially; (b) Widely-adopted data augmentation method in image recognition deteriorates aspect ratios, which is an important factor in image aesthetics assessment. An aspect ratio representation learning method, namely adaptive fractional dilated convolution, is proposed to explicitly preserve the learning representation related to aspect ratios by adjusting the receptive fields adaptively and natively; (c) Identification tasks, e.g. person re-identification, aim at learning representations that are robust to interfering variances, e.g. lighting variances, view variances, pose variances. An invariance representation learning method, namely anchor loss, is proposed to train a robust feature extractor, which distills the identity-related representations while disentangling and removing interfering variances by global supervision under local mini-batch training; (d) Color recognition is entangled with compositional representation in both visual perception and language attentions. A compositional learning module with attention to key colors is proposed to learn better color representations. Besides, another compositional learning method, namely classifier as descriptor, is proposed for long-tail color recognition by incorporating the rich knowledge in classifier representations to remove the bias from bias-trainedmodel.Through extensive experiments and thorough analysis, we demonstrate some novel insights about the impacts of four factors, i.e. diversity, receptive field, invariance, and composition. Several methods are proposed to learn better representations for those factors, achieving state-of-the-art results in different tasks.",
"Revealing the Hidden Layers in an Environment: A Case Study of the Visualization of the Coronavirus Contamination and Navigation in a Hospital","Ebrahimi, Arghavan",2021,"The current global pandemic experience has had significant influences on the health and economy of the entire world. Researchers around the world sought to understand the current situation and provide strategic solutions to protect the health of people in the community and reduce the damage and mortality. In this regard, this thesis attempts to develop a spatial spread model of COVID-19 within architectural spaces. It provides a method for evaluating the passages and the infection probability from traveling through the contaminated spaces, which have been divided into two categories, one category is the wide-open spaces and the other corridor-based spaces; These categories rely on various ways the developed algorithm is applied. The proposed model can be adopted to assess the existing systems as to the resistance to the infection. Furthermore can be applied to present more safe assistance in the navigation through an existing architectural setting. The model is subject to the discovery of epidemiological data and can be adjusted to reflect new epidemiological evidence.",
"Role of Intramolecular Electrostatic Interactions on the Kinetics of Human Cardiac Myosin β-Isoform","Gargey, Akhil",2021,"Human cardiac myosin has two isoforms, α and β, sharing significant sequence similarity, but different in kinetics. Small differences in the sequence are responsible for distinct local inter-residue interactions within α and β isoforms, leading to such a dramatic difference in the rate of ADP release. Our analysis of structural kinetics of α and β isoforms using molecular dynamics simulations revealed distinct dynamics in SH1:SH2 helix region, loop 1 region, and loop I289-D324 region of myosin head. We identified permanent salt bridges in these regions on β-isoform, which are not presentin the α - isoform. We hypothesized that the isoform-specific electrostatic interactions play a role in the difference of kinetic properties of myosin isoforms. We prepared R694N, E45Q, I303V:I313V,and D208Q:K450L mutants in the β-isoform background to destabilize electrostatic interactions in the proposed regions of the myosin head. We recombinantly expressed Wild type (WT) and the mutants of the human cardiac myosin head construct (1-843 amino acid residues) in differentiated C2C12 cells. Using the transient kinetics assays, we measured the kinetics of ADP release from actomyosin in the WT and mutant constructs of human cardiac myosin β-isoform. Mutant R694N showed faster rate of ADP release from actomyosin, compared to the wild type and other mutants, thus confirming that electrostatic interactions within the force-generating region of human cardiac myosin regulate ADP release and the duration of the strongly bound state of actomyosin.",
"Safe Opioid Prescribing in Primary Care Through Implementation of Evidence-Based Guidelines","Starnes, Michelle",2021,"Many people are affected by chronic pain. The use of opioids for pain has resulted in an increase in the number of opioid-related overdose deaths. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) created opioid prescribing guidelines to help providers safely prescribe opioids for chronic pain. The purpose of this project was to create an electronic medical record (EMR) template and urine drug test (UDT) alert to increase the providers’ adherence to the CDC opioid guidelines in a small, hospital-owned, family practice clinic. A pre/post implementation chart review tool was used to evaluate the medical records of 60 patients prescribed chronic opioids. The tool was used to determine if providers were adhering to the guidelines. Measures included the number of patients who completed an annual UDT, signed a controlled substance agreement (CSA), documented pain diagnosis, quarterly office visits, and if providers reviewed the prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) every 3 months. Adherence improved in the post-implementation data compared to pre-implementation. There were statistically significant increases in CSA (p<.001), PDMP reviewed (p=.000), annual UDT (p=.005), and quarterly appointments (p=.006). Although not statistically significant, there was an increase in documented pain diagnosis (p=.492). Implementation of an EMR template and UDT alert led to an increase in provider adherence to opioid prescribing guidelines.",
"School Building Level Administrators and Special Education: Roles, Responsibilities, and Expectations","Carney, Tracey",2021,"Special education has transformed over the last three decades to ensure the provision of services and instructional practices are provided for students with disabilities. However, there a disconnect remains between special education and the required knowledge an administrator needs in order to be effective for special education. As a result of the lack of knowledge many administrators have about special education, litigation and due process requests have continued to increase at a steady rate. A majority of administrators have reported lacking a fundamental understanding of special education law, instructional practices, and service delivery. This lack of understanding has impacted special education students and instructional practices. Additionally, accountability measures indicated a significant achievement gap between students with disabilities and their peers. Given these concerns, a need for research continues to exist to ascertain the most effective ways to improve administrator’s knowledge about special education in order to improve student outcomes.This qualitative, comparative case study aimed to explore perceptions about the role of an administrator for special education programming in order to identify specific areas of special education programming knowledge administrators need to be effective for special education. Interviews were conducted with three key stakeholder groups: special education teachers, general education teachers, and administrators, in order to ascertain converging and diverging perspectives about the role of an administrator for special education programming. Findings in this study supported prior work around the lack of knowledge administrators had about special education law and practice. However, the findings expanded on those further exploring the skills required to implement the knowledge administrators need in order to be effective for special education programming. Specifically, this study found that educational philosophy was an influential aspect to overall effectiveness of administrators for special education. Additionally, championing for the betterment of all stakeholders, and growth mindset were identified as areas necessary for an administrator to be effective for special education programming. These findings support the need for additional training that education administrators should receive to not only understand special education law, but also understand how to be an effective administrator for special education programming. Results reflect a need for administrators to have underlying knowledge about special education in addition to the soft skills needed to effectively support and oversee special education programming in their school.",
"Science of Multiphysics Behavior of Si/C Composite Active Particles in Anodes","Gao, Xiang",2021,"The rapidly growing demands on energy storage technologies over the last decade have imposed further requirements for the high energy/power density, safety, and durability of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Si/C composite materials have attracted enormous research interest as the most promising candidates for the anodes of next-generation lithium-ion batteries, owing to their high energy density and mechanical buffering property. However, the major disadvantage of materials with ultra-high capacities, such as Si-based materials, is the significant volume change during cycling, which further leads to mechanical and electrochemical degradation. A comprehensive computational model is indispensable in the developing process of the excellent performance of anode material due to the low realizability, inconvenience, and high cost of experiments, which also provides powerful tools for fabrication guidance of novel Si/C composites designs. Further, the fundamental mechanism of Li diffusion and complex failure behaviors in various Si/C composite materials remains unclear, with our understanding limited by experimental techniques and continuum modeling methodologies. Thus, DFT simulation is firstly used to investigate the Li diffusion behavior in Si/C composite materials, which indicates the underlying mechanism and provides a quantitative description of the diffusivity. A multiphysics modeling framework is then established. The relationship between mechanical failure and electrochemical performance in Si/C core-shell particles is revealed using this model. Further, based on this multiphysics model, the contact behavior of two Si/C core-shell particles is studied, and five representative nanostructures are compared, providing design guidance on Si/C core-shell and related structures. Finally, the model is extended into a multi-scale one, which can describe the multiphysics behavior both at the particle level and cell level. This study explores the multiphysics behavior of Si/C anodes material from the atomic level to cell level using DFT modeling and FEA methodology, systematically revealing the coupling mechanism among various physical fields, as well as providing efficient and powerful tools in the design, development, and evaluation of high energy density lithium-ion batteries.",
"Secure Cryptographic Designs Resilient to Side-Channel Attacks","Gui, Yutian",2021,"The rapid development of IoT devices and distributed computing brings convenience and high efficiency to modern society. To enhance the security of hardware devices, quite a few cryptographic algorithms were proposed and applied. These encryption algorithms show good resilience to brute-force attacks, but are still vulnerable to side-channel attacks. Side-channel attacks are non-invasive and passive attack that shows high efficiency on secret data extraction and brings a lot of difficulties for detection and defense. Unlike the brute-force attack and the cryptanalysis attack, that targets the weakness in the encryption algorithm, side-channel attacks utilize weaknesses of implementation and use statistical models such as differential analysis and correlation analysis to steal secret information. In this work, we explore different side-channel attacks and propose feasible countermeasures for mitigation, including power-based analysis, electromagnetic-based analysis and Direct Memory Access(DMA) attack. For power/EM based side channel attacks, we first demonstrate multiple attacks on both software-based implementation and hardware-based implementation, including template attack, power-based correlation analysis, and EM-based correlation analysis. To mitigate the risk, we propose a key update scheme to provide resilience to correlation-based side-channel attacks for encryption engine and prove the efficiency by experiments. To protect the process of key generation and key storage from the tampering attack, we use a secure coprocessor to generate and store secret keys. For DMA attack, we propose a lightweight scheme to provide resilience without any physical and protocol-level modification. The proposed scheme constructs a unique identifier for each DMA-supported PCIe device based on profiling time and builds a trusted database for authentication. The efficiency is also tested and proved by experiments.",
"Secure RISCV Design for Side-Channel Evaluation Platform","Thakar, Bhavin",2021,"In the era of smart technology, IoT technology has been an integral part of the system. IoT systems are susceptible to many type of attacks such as buffer overflow attack and execution flow attacks. Information flow tracking is a technique to monitor the control flow of the program and mitigate the buffer overflow attack.The open source architecture has several applications in design and simulations of security applications such as Common Evaluation Platform(CEP). CEP is a RISC-V based simulation framework for side channel analysis to analyze power traces. These application rely on secure execution, and can have adverse affects if the underlying framework is compromised. Our research focuses on security of RISC-V architecture and its simulation framework of security enabled RISC-V design and simulation to enable hardening the design to be resilient to hardware attacks and capability of run time detection of any attacks. CEP version 1.2 is based on RISC-V ISA, so focus of this thesis is to develop the software simulation model of ISA Level Information Flow Tracking on RISC-V ISA which can be used as a parallel tool to evaluate these new security extension without the need of the hardware to test it. The steps discussed about Assembler modification in this thesis can be used for adding and deploying new instructions within the ISA. An attack setup is developed to manipulate the return address which results in the change of program control flow and also demonstrate the security extensions integrated in the simulation framework to illustrate the security extensions which can detect the attack at run-time.",
"Seeking an Identity: Kabul's Enduring Struggle with Modernization (1960-1979)","Durani, Qaisara",2021,"This thesis analyzed the Kabul Times archive to assess what modernization meant to the elite in Kabul. By examining the period of modernization this paper highlights why Afghans did accept modernization efforts, but shows why Afghan leaders failed to bring forward any meaningful change. Instead, Afghan leaders used broad terms such as modernization to achieve their own personal gain. The research from this study also provides an interesting fact about the Kabul Times newspaper. The government publication was used as a propaganda tool for the sitting government in Afghanistan. It did not matter what tribe, ideology, or vision the different governments promoted, the Kabul Times often contradicted itself in order to improve the image of different Afghan leaders.",
"Semiparametric Additive Hazards Models with Missing Covariates","Subedi, Pramesh",2021,"The case-cohort study design was originally proposed by Prentice (1986). Under this design,a random sub-cohort of individuals is selected from the cohort of study. Full covariate data are collected from all the cases in the cohort and the sub-cohort, not all the original cohort, saving time and money if measures such as biomarkers or genotypes are required. Thus, certain covariates will be missing from a large number of individuals in the cohort of study. This design has been widely used in clinical and epidemiological studies to study the effect of covariates on failure times. The Cox proportional hazards model (Cox 1972) is a popular and classical choice in such data due to its nice interpretation of regression coefficients and the availability of efficient inference procedures implemented in all statistical software packages. Few other methods allow for time varying regression coefficients. An underlying assumption of the Cox model is the so-called proportional hazards assumption, that is, the hazard ratio remains constant over time or covariates have log-linear effects on the risk of the event of interest. However, in many real datasets, covariates may exhibit much more complicated effects than log-linear effects; thus, the proportional hazards assumption may be violated, and the Cox model may not be an appropriate choice. In addition, most methods do not use the data of the non-cases that are outside of sub-cohort which results into inefficient inference. Addressing these issues, we have proposed an estimation procedure for the semiparametric additive hazards model for case-cohort data, allowing the covariates of interest to be missing for cases and for non-cases. We have considered an additive model in which effects of some covariates are time varying while the effects of some other covariates are constants. Further, we have assumed that the missing covariates have constant effect on failure time. We have proposed an Augmented Inverse Probability Weighted Estimation (AIPW) procedure. It uses auxiliary information that is correlated with missing covariates. We have established the asymptotic properties of the proposed AIPW estimation. Our simulation study shows that Augmented Inverse Probability Weighted estimation is more efficient than the widely used Inverse probability Weighed (IPW) and Complete case estimation method. This result is apparent if the sub cohort is very small. The method is applied to analyze a data from a HIV vaccine efficacy trial.",
"Sequence Prediction Applied to BIM Log Data, An Approach to Develop a Command Recommender System for BIM Software Application","Radnia, Ashkan",2021,"Building Information Modeling has become an industry standard for designing, documenting, and collaborating within the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. Architects spend most of their time developing projects from the feasibility study phase through post occupancy operation using BIM software such as Autodesk Revit. There are many tools created to automate tedious tasks or speed up the design process, however, most tasks require manual work, therefore taking longer to complete and increasing the probability of design errors. With each new release software developers are adding more features and tools to increase application capabilities; however, these are often underutilized since the proper training and resources for adopting the tools are not always available. Due to this limitation, designers will tend to stick to the tools they are already comfortable that are not necessarily best fit for all tasks. This thesis aims to investigate using Autodesk Revit Journals as a non-intrusive method to extract sequential data about user interactions with the software and use collected data to conduct analysis on design and work patterns of users. Additionally, collected data is used to develop a neural network that takes sequence of user commands and trains to predict the next command. The developed neural network can serve as a recommender system suggesting the most suitable commands for the user, enabling improved and efficient workflows and enforcement of best modeling practices.",
"Service Learning: Social-Emotional Development and Civic-Engagement of Elementary School Students","Miller, Aimee",2021,"ABSTRACTAIMEE MOORE MILLER. Service-Learning: Social-Emotional Development and Civic-Engagement of Elementary School Students. (Under the direction of DR. REBECCA SHORE).Social-emotional learning and character education are topics which have both become more commonplace in schools (Shriver & Weissberg, 2020). While no one reason has been identified, many school children seem to have become more self-absorbed and are less engaged in their communities (Borba, 2016; Turkle, 2015). Some scholars suggest this has impacted their ability to have positive interactions with their peers as well as kept them from developing an awareness of and connection to their communities. Borba (2016) and Turkle (2015) suggest that involving students in their communities through service is a possible strategy to help develop empathy and civic engagement in children. This bounded, single-case study explored the potential influence of a service-learning experience on second-grade students. Students participated in a seven-session module designed by the researcher over the course of four weeks, and completed surveys before and after their participation. Qualitative data was compiled from written reflection journals, discussion transcripts, and observations, and quantitative data was collected from surveys conducted at the beginning and end of the study. A line-by-line analysis of the qualitative data produced themes of emotion, empathy and civic engagement. Students demonstrated some understanding of the themes; however, there was no significant change in any of the students’ responses over time. A paired t-test of the quantitative data did not show any significant influence. Limitations related to the short duration of the study, and the lack of student voice may have hampered identifiable influences in students.",
"Spatial and Temporal Variability of Tornadic versus Non-Tornadic High-Shear, Low-CAPE Environments","Hochstatter, Lindsay",2021,"High-shear low-CAPE (HSLC) severe weather events, defined as those in which surface-based CAPE is below 500 J/kg and most unstable CAPE is less than 1000 J/kg and have a 0-6 km bulk wind difference of at least 18 m/s, are uniquely challenging to forecasters due to their rapid evolution times and relatively infrequent production of severe weather. Additionally, these environments tend to occur during the cool season and overnight hours, which present their own challenges in terms of current conceptual understanding, forecaster verification, and societal impacts. To better understand how rapid environmental evolution contributes to severe weather production in HSLC environments, 224 tornado reports from HSLC events in the southeastern U.S. between 2014-2018 were categorized based on their radar signature near the time of tornadogenesis. More than half of the reports were from supercells, with the next largest contributor being bowing segments. Next, Rapid Refresh (RAP) model analysis soundings are used to characterize the near-storm environment and its spatiotemporal evolution, focusing on the time of tornadogenesis, as well as the hour before. For comparison, two other storm-relative locations (offset to the north and south, forming a grid) also had their environmental changes quantified. Perhaps unsurprisingly, as is also the case for radar signals of HSLC tornadogenesis, many of the observed environmental differences were very subtle. The most useful parameters for mesoanalysis as events unfold appear to be related to environmental moisture, as instability uniquely decreases preceding tornadogenesis for many cases within the dataset, and kinematic variables show very marginal changes. The key for increased potential for tornadogenesis appears to be most directly related to the spatial variations in surface and mid-level moisture, both of which are most favorably enhanced at the tornadic inflow environment.",
"Students' Perceptions of Motivation and Use of Metacognitive Self-regulated Learning Strategies in Remote Asynchronous Elementary Spanish Classes","Esparragoza, Rosalba",2021,"The purpose of the study was to investigate whether intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, task value, metacognitive self-regulation, self-efficacy for learning, and cumulative GPA predicts academic success among college students enrolled in remote, asynchronous Elementary Spanish I and II courses. The study was conducted during the Summer 2020 term at a large urban research university in the Southeastern United States. One hundred and sixty-eight of 301 undergraduates responded to the survey resulting in a 56% response rate. The results of the multiple regression indicated that 41% of the variance in Spanish course grades was accounted for by the predictor variables. Three of the predictor variables were statistically significant, self-efficacy, metacognitive self-regulation, and cumulative GPA. Self-efficacy and cumulative GPA showed a positive relationship to course grade after controlling for all predictor variables. Metacognitive self-regulation, which was positively correlated to course grade, had a negative relationship to course grade when predictor variables were included in the model. Intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, and task value were not significant predictors of the course grade. Implications and applications for teaching remote asynchronous elementary Spanish classes are discussed.",
"Study of Thermo-Mechanical Properties of Graphene-Like Two Dimensional Material","Elapolu, Mohan Surya Raja",2021,"Graphene is a layer of covalently bonded carbon atoms with a honeycomb lattice structure. It has exceptional properties, due to which it became prominent in a wide range of applications. The enormous success of graphene raised curtains to a new class of two-dimensional materials. In this research we employed molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning methods to study thermo-mechanical properties of graphene-like two dimensional materials. Reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics method has been employed to study the thermal transport properties of hexagonal-boron nitride (h-BN) nanoribbons, and C3N nanotubes (C3NNT). Our results showed that effective thermal conductivity of h-BN nanoribbons is in the range of 75 - 160 W/m-K whereas Kapitza conductance of grain boundaries is in the range of 6 - 20 GW/m2-K. By increasing the misorientation angle the defect density at the grain boundaries increases due to which, the Kapitza conductance of the grain boundaries and the effective thermal conductivity of the h-BN nanoribbon decreases. Our MD simulations showed that a lower ballistic to diffusive transition length (72 - 80 nm) for C3NNT compared to CNT (103 - 107 nm). Due to the stiffer acoustic modes of CNT. Thermal conductivity of CNT is significantly higher than that of C3NNT across the entire ballistic-diffusive range. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the mechanical properties of graphene-like two-dimensional material with focus on MoS2 and graphene. The toughness and strength of the MoS2 sheets are not significantly affected by increase in the number of layers from one to three. Griffith theory is not valid for nanoscale cracks of MoS2. In comparison to Inglis theory, quantized fracture mechanics give better prediction for the fracture strength of MoS2 sheets when the crack tips are very sharp. Environmental molecules like H2, O2, CO2, and H2O can react with material, and accelerate its failure. Hence, it is important to understand the environment-assisted cracking in two–dimensional materials. The stress corrosion cracking in mono crystalline graphene in the presence of O2 molecules are studied. The strained graphene sheet is exposed to oxygen molecules. Our MD and density functional-based tight bonding simulations show that cracks in graphene can grow due to chemical reactions with environmental molecules. The results show that sub-critical crack growth can occur in graphene sheets when exposed to O2 molecules. The mechanical and fracture properties of bicrystalline and polycrystalline graphene sheets with hydrogenated grain boundaries are studied. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to extract the traction-separation laws (TSL) of the hydrogenated grain boundaries of bicrystalline graphene. The adsorption site is an important factor for determining the level of the impact of hydrogenation on the fracture properties of the grain boundary. On the other hand, crack propagation path in the polycrystalline graphene sheet is affected by the hydrogenation of the grain boundaries. The crack prefers to grow along an intragranular path at lower hydrogenation percentage, whereas at higher hydrogenation percentage it changes to intergranular. Our results have showed that hydrogen embrittlement at grain boundaries is degrading the bicrystalline and polycrystalline graphene sheet due to which the strength and fracture toughness is decreasing. Finally, A machine learning model has been developed to predict crack propagation path in polycrystalline graphene. The model is a combination of convolutional neural network, bidirectional recurrent neural network, and fully connected layers. The data set used to train the machine learning model is obtained using MD simulations. Fully trained ML model can predict the crack path in polycrystalline graphene sheet. The predicted crack path from the ML model is in close agreement with the one obtained from MD simulations.",
"THE USE OF MACHINE LEARNING METHOD FOR MODELING AND ANALYZING PEDESTRIAN CRASH DATA AND COMPARISONS WITH TRADITIONAL DISCRETE CHOICE METHODS","Li, Yang",2021,"As one of the most vulnerable entity within the transportation system, pedestrians might face more dangers and sustain severer injuries in the traffic crashes than others. The safety of pedestrians is particularly critical within the context of continuous traffic safety improvements in US. Moreover, traffic crash data are inherently heterogeneous, and such data heterogeneity can cause one to draw incorrect conclusions in many ways. Therefore, developments and applications of proper modeling approaches are needed to identify causes of pedestrian-vehicle crashes to better ensure the safety of pedestrians. On the other hand, with the development of artificial intelligence techniques, a variety of novel machine learning methods have been established. Compared to conventional discrete choice models (DCMs), machine learning models are more flexible with no or few prior assumptions about input variables and have higher adaptability to process outliers, missing and noisy data. Furthermore, the crash data has inherent patterns related to both space and time, crashes happened in locations with highly aggregated uptrend patterns should be worth exploring to examine the most recently deteriorative factors affecting the pedestrian injury severities in crashes. The major goal of this dissertation is intended to build a framework for modeling and analyzing pedestrian injury severities in single-pedestrian-single-vehicle crashes with providing a higher resolution on identification of contributing factors and their associating effects on the injury severities of pedestrians, particularly on those most recently deteriorative factors. Developments of both conventional DCMs and the selected machine learning model, i.e., XGBoost model, are established. Detailed comparisons among all developed models are conducted with a result showing that XGBoost model outperforms all other conventional DCMs in all selected measurements. In addition, an emerging hotspot analysis is further utilized to identify the most targeted hotspots, followed by a proposed XGBoost model that analyzes the most recently deteriorative factors affecting the pedestrian injury severities. By completions of all abovementioned tasks, the gaps between theory and practice could be bridged. Summary and conclusions of the whole research are provided, and further research directions are given at the end.",

"Teaching the Teachers: A Case Study of Instructional Leader Professional Development","Sykes, Melissa",2021,"The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore professional development from the perspective of instructional leaders to identify if the assumptions of Knowles’s (1990) Adult Learning Theory were present in the planning and implementation ofcontinuing education. For the purposes of this research study, professional development was defined as opportunities for learning offered to teachers to support and enhance teacher practices. An instructional leader is defined as an educator, also known as a learning leader, focused on effective, research-based instruction and strategies. Instructional leaders plan and implement learning opportunities and demonstrate and share their knowledge to encourage student achievement, provide support of practitioners, improve student and educator practice, and promote continuous growth.A qualitative case study research design was utilized, and the research setting was dependent on the participants and the locations in which they were contracted to conduct continuing education sessions with teachers. The instructional leaders were committed to plan and present professional development at three different suburban schools surrounding a city in the Southeastern United States. The participants in the study were instructional leaders and educational consultants with at least 10 years of experience who work across school districts with multiple elementary, middle, and high school sites in suburban and urban districts. Data sources included two rounds of interviews, observations of planned and implemented professional development, and document analysis of staff development materials. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis that included within-case and cross-case investigation.",
"The Association of Frequency of Utilizing Student Services with Student Success at a Community College","Kendra-Dill, Zachary",2021,"As colleges work to meet performance standards, staff have been placed in key service areas to help students be successful. With the majority of the seven million community college students attending part-time, needing developmental education, and not graduating on time, it is vital that students take advantage of services such as academic advising, financial aid advising, tutoring, career counseling, student organizations, disability services, and military/veteran’s services (American Association of Community Colleges, 2019a; McClenny, 2016; Tippett & Kahn, 2018a). Students who utilize some of these services have been retained and had higher grade point averages (GPA) than students who did not use these services (Bremer et al., 2013; Drake, 2011; Habley et al., 2010; Hatch & Garcia, 2017; McClenney & Dare, 2013; Nakajima et al., 2012; Smith & Allen, 2014). By making use of the provided services, students were more successful, but the frequency of visits to these services has not been analyzed in-depth. Using data from one institution’s Community College Survey of Student Engagement (CCSSE), this study set out to determine if there was an association between the frequency of use of a service and the student’s GPA or intent to return to that college for future semesters. The research questions that guided this study ask if there is a relationship between the frequency of service utilization and student success. By using an analysis of variance to examine the data, it was determined that the reported frequency of using financial aid advising showed a statistically significant difference in the student’s GPA. The research did not find any statistically significant differences in a student’s GPA for the use of multiple services nor a statistically significant difference in a student’s intent to return based on the use of services. Based on this study, community colleges will want to determine the individual services offered by financial aid advising and how to best adapt a financial aid advising program to assist those students who are visiting more often and not seeing academic success.",

THE BALANCING OF THE ARTIST-TEACHER DUAL IDENTITY IN K-12 PUBLIC SCHOOL VISUAL ART EDUCATORS(Under the direction of Dr. Rebecca Shore) The purpose of this narrative qualitative study was to explore how artist-teachers perceive themselves, their strategies for maintaining a balance of the artist-teacher dual identity and their perceived benefits for students. This study included eight participants with a minimum of five years of teaching art in a K-12 public school who considered themselves an artist-teacher. The analyzed data resulted in the following findings: K-12 artist-teachers perceive themselves as having a dual identity of both an art educator and practicing artist, that early artmaking experiences and past art teachers were influential in their identity formation and that in addition to teaching, personal artmaking is needed for their job satisfaction and life fulfillment. Findings also include: K-12 artist-teachers maintain the balance of their dual identity by having a designated place for art making, prioritizing and scheduling time for their art practice and connecting with other creative individuals or groups for accountability and collaboration. Additionally, this study’s findings demonstrates that K-12 artist-teachers perceive their dual identity benefitting students by infusing excitement and energy from their own artistic practice into their teaching, building strong connections through shared experiences and explorations, and readily integrating and introducing students to diverse and relevant contemporary artists. Implications include increased professional development for art educators in opportunities for collaboration, knowledge of new media and techniques and methods for integration of diverse and contemporary artists. Additional implications include increased training for preservice art educators on attaining and sustaining the balance of the artist-teacher identity .",
"The Broken Shelves: Ex-Mormon Reddit Narratives of Deconversion","Wright, Lesley",2021,"What are the reasons ex-Mormons give for why they leave their religion? This study identifies what causes Mormons to lose their religion—or to use an ex-Mormon parlance—causes their shelf to break, by analyzing online deconversion narratives posted on the exmormon subreddit forum from 2015 through 2020. Concurring with Dehlin, Brooks and Riess, ex-Mormons give a variety of historical, doctrinal, personal, and social reasons for why they left. This study additionally shows that they say they leave due to the current LDS administrative and ecclesiastical leadership and what they are learning on the internet, including ex-Mormon online communities like Reddit. This study suggests that the recent institutional changes enacted by the current LDS leaders are causing Mormons to doubt and reject these leaders. Furthermore, this study reveals that the growing influence of online media and ex-religious communities is causing a digital deconversion among Mormons.",
"The Design, Calibration, and Commissioning of a Benchmark Hypersonic Wind Tunnel","Solomon, Jason",2021,"In 2020, the United States Department of Defense requested $3.2 billion to fund research and development in hypersonic defense programs for the fiscal year of 2021. The demand for funding in hypersonic research directly responds to the increasing gap between hypersonic weapon capabilities between the United States and foreign entities. This gap in hypersonic research stems from a lack of specialized personnel, facilities, and hypersonic academic programs in the United States. I argue that the improvements in U.S. hypersonic programs rely on increasing the availability and implementation of hypersonic academic courses and labs in the collegiate curriculum. My thesis expands on these improvements by correlating the process of researching, designing, and constructing a benchmark blow-down hypersonic wind tunnel to create trained graduate students prepared to work within the hypersonic research field. This hypersonic wind tunnel, which was designed and built by a multidisciplinary team of senior year college students under my leadership, can train students to evaluate and measure changes in pressure, temperature, flow velocity, shock wave angles, boundary layers, and additional properties of hypersonic flow up to Mach 5 as it flows over a solid body. It provides these capabilities using various pressure sensors, pitot tubes, Schlieren imaging, and thermocouples integrated throughout the system's design. The collected experimental data is validated using CFD and other numerical simulation programs. I conclude with a discussion on the potential impact of training and preparing graduate students to answer the national call for hypersonic researchers and facility personnel.",
"The Effect of Child Access Prevention Laws on Unintentional Shootings Perpetrated by Children","Nussbaum, Sofia",2021,"Holding gun owners responsible when a child accesses a firearm is one of the reasons Child Access Prevention Laws emerged. Previous studies have focused on fatal shootings in which the victim is a child without identifying the age of the perpetrator. This study will address the effectiveness of underage shootings from another perspective. With data retrieved from the Gun Violence Archive and EveryTown for Gun Safety from 2014- 2018, I will analyze the relationship between CAP laws and unintentional shootings by a minor, no matter the age of the victim.To deepen our analysis of the effects and effectiveness of these laws, I will also examine the effects of the charges associated with them. These are defined through three different categories: whether the child may or is likely to gain access to a carelessly stored gun, accesses a carelessly stored gun, or is intentionally given a gun by the owner. Previous studies show there is a relationship between whether the gun owner is charged with a felony or misdemeanor and the decline in unintentional firearm deaths and firearm suicides among children and adolescents. In this research, we will address the effects of penalties under the three previously mentioned categories.",
"The Effects of Correctional Education on Prison Misconduct","Shaw, Olivia",2021,"The relationship between correctional education and recidivism rates have often been overwhelming with support. However, the examination of whether correctional education affects prisoner misconduct is significantly underrepresented in criminological research. This study aims to determine whether participation in a correctional education program reduces rates of prisoner misconduct. The data utilized for the study was collected by the Bureau of Justice and included a nationally representative sample of male and female inmates within state and federal correctional facilities. However, for the purpose of the study only federal inmates were examined. Results revealed that those that participated in education were more likely to engage in prison misconduct. As for policy implications, the adoption of the RNR model, specifically including components of cognitive behavioral therapy programs were addressed.",
"The Efficacy of An Educational Intervention on Latinas' Cervical Cancer Screening Knowledge","Harper, Amber",2021,"Latinas’ lack of knowledge regarding cervical cancer screening (CCS) guidelines has a significant impact on CCS adherence and ultimately impacts their health outcomes related to cervical cancer. Studies have demonstrated that small media, culturally relevant educational interventions are highly effective in improving Latinas’ knowledge of CCS (Moran et al., 2016; Thompson et al., 2019; Warner et al., 2018). The purpose of this scholarly project was to implement and evaluate the efficacy of a small media educational intervention on Latinas’ knowledge of CCS and human papillomavirus (HPV) and evaluate the participants’ satisfaction with the intervention. A convenience sample of 50 Hispanic female patients between the ages of 21-65 was obtained from a community health center in the Southeast region of the United States. The fotonovela utilized in the Thompson et al. (2019) study was the intervention used for this project; it was offered in Spanish and English and included information on CCS and HPV. A pre- and post-test questionnaire assessing the participants’ CCS and HPV knowledge was administered. In addition, the post-questionnaire included questions that evaluated the participants’ satisfaction with the fotonovela. Following implementation of the fotonovela, participants significantly increased their average post-test CCS and HPV knowledge scores (Pre: 50.6; Post: 83.6, p<.000). All 50 participants (100%) reported overall satisfaction with the fotonovela. The findings of this project were both statistically and clinically significant indicating that the fotonovela is an effective and favorable educational intervention, thus its implementation is warranted in healthcare settings that provide care to Latinas.

"The Evaluation of an Educational Intervention on Food Label Literacy Among Parents of Children in an Outpatient Pediatric Clinic","Okocha, Ifunanya",2021,"Childhood obesity has been on the rise for decades and its effects have a negative impact on the health, psychology of the people with significant economic cost to the society at large. Many risk factors have been attributed to obesity such as quality and quantity of food, high calorie intake, sugary drinks, and sedentary lifestyle, but not much is emphasized on nutrition label literacy. This project is to evaluate the effect of an educational intervention to improve parents’ nutrition label literacy intended to help parents make healthy food choices for their children. This quantitative descriptive study was conducted at an outpatient pediatric clinic among parents and guardians using a paper and pencil survey. The participants completed a demographic survey for an overview of the participants’ background such as gender, age, and socioeconomic status. One of the aims of the project was to identify the participants’ nutrition label literacy by administering a FLLANK pretest. The goal of the project was to evaluate the impact of an educational intervention by assessing the participants’ performances in the FLLANK post-test. A total of 30 participants completed the pre and post intervention questionnaire. 53.3% (n=16) of the participants were above the age of 35 and 83.3% (n=25) were females. 73.3% (n=22) of the participants had a minimum of a 2-year college degree and 60% (n=18) earned more than $45,000/ year. 46.7% (n=14) of the participants identified as Hispanics or African Americans, respectively. 70% (n=21) of the participants indicated they understood food labels, while 60% (n=18) reported that they would buy food items based on how the packaging looked. Overall, the majority (86.7%, n=26) of the participants indicated that they would like to learn and understand nutrition labels despite the fact that the majority of the participants had at least a 2-year college education. The results showed that irrespective of socioeconomic status, the participants improved in their nutrition label literacy after the educational intervention. The long-term goal of this project will be to observe a consistent reduction in childhood obesity as the parents make healthy food choices. Keywords or phrases: nutrition labeling, parents’ food perceptions, childhood obesity, obesity prevention, adolescents and obesity, nutrition facts, food label utilization, nutrition label comprehension, health literacy, and parent food literacy.",

"The Haqqani Network: An Underestimated Force?","Davis, Shelby",2021,"The catastrophic events of September 11, 2001 and the beheading of James Foley on August 19, 2014 were the tipping points in the United States’ infamous war on terrorism. The countless tragedies and years of war have demonstrated the unprecedented brutality of the terrorist organizations Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, who have become household names for Americans. However, despite their notoriety, these two groups may not be the most lethal nor the most strategically capable of extremist organizations. Rather, hidden by mountainous Afghanistan, the Haqqani Network has established itself as a competent enemy for five decades now, all while evading the general public’s eye. Despite its persistent presence in Afghanistan since the Soviet-Afghan War and the extensive qualitative literature discussing the breadth of its capabilities and reach, the Haqqani Network’s potential lethality does not appear to be reflected in its respective quantitative data. This study explores the potential underestimations of the Haqqani Network’s breadth of attacks in Afghanistan within the Global Terrorism Database through association rules mining and two Naive Bayes classifiers. Since the extremist group’s creation, the Global Terrorism Database has only attributed 84 attacks within Afghanistan to the Haqqani Network. This study will therefore explore whether or not there is reason to suspect that the GTD has severely undercounted the Haqqani Network’s capabilities in Afghanistan through machine learning.",
"The Impact of Organizational Environment on Reporting Sexual Harassment: A Meta-Analytic Review","Best, Emma",2021,"This meta-analytic review integrates a micro-perspective theory of coping responses with the macro-perspective institutional theory of moral collapse to understand the likelihood of an employee reporting sexual harassment. I build on previous studies to evaluate three broad research questions: (1) What is the relatively most important predictor of workplace sexual harassment?; (2) To what extent do contingency factors influence employees reporting sexual harassment?; and (3) What are the gaps in the macro literature that need to be addressed to integrate macro and micro perspectives? Based on previous research, classifications of individual-, industry-, and country-level factors are proposed that influence reporting sexual harassment and then are used in the analysis of 284 independent samples, consisting of 538,426 individuals. First, perception of the global organizational environment may be a relatively more important predictor of reporting sexual harassment than the individual difference variables of age and tenure under the institutional theory of moral collapse (Lawrence, 2011). For example, justice climate had a large effect size ( = .43) in comparison to gender ( = -.29) and age ( = -.19) when predicting the reporting of work-related harassment. In addition, this study shows the extent to which various job attitudes correlated with the likelihood to report sexual harassment as employees’ coping response (Sigal et al., 2003). Second, the power and masculinity norms of the country where the business is located as well as the type of industry are contingency factors that likely moderate the relationship between global organizational environment and reporting sexual harassment as a coping response (Hofstede, 2015). The evidence shows that there was a large effect size difference between the correlation of the perceptions of the global organizational environment and reporting sexual harassment when moderated by the high-power distance in other countries ( = .24) compared to the United States ( = -.23). Third, there is a lack of macro-level research with only 15% of the studies utilizing variables considered firm-level antecedents of sexual harassment, and only 3% of them focusing on firms' responses to sexual harassment claims in this meta-analysis. In the Discussion, I identify several gaps in the literature, suggest directions for future research, and highlight organizational policies to reduce the risk of sexual harassment.  ",
"The Impact of Stream Restoration on Macroinvertebrate Communities in an Urban Forested Watershed","Hartman, Jacqueline",2021,"Stream restoration can lead to improved habitat quality, increased macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity, and reduced concentrations of nutrients and contaminants. Macroinvertebrates are vital in connecting the food web and breaking down organic matter to provide energy for higher trophic levels. Not only are macroinvertebrates important for the function of stream ecosystems but they also serve as biotic indicators of stream health. Based on species presence and abundance practitioners can determine if the stream water quality is ‘poor’ or ‘excellent.’ To study the impact of stream restoration on macroinvertebrate communities, a multi-year project at Reedy Creek Reserve was designed. The Reedy Creek watershed is a 14 mi2 urban forested watershed located in a nature preserve. Within the headwaters of the watershed, 5 sub-watersheds were delineated based on the surrounding land-use influence of development (D2, D1), forested control with restoration (C1), forested control without restoration (C2), pond (P1), agricultural (A4, A3, A3, A1) and Reedy (R2, R1). Taxa richness, EPT richness, total abundance, the North Carolina Biotic Index (NCBI), and EPT biomass were measured to study the impact of stream restoration on macroinvertebrate communities. A Before-After-Control-Impact study design was used to determine if restoration had a significant impact on the study metrics. Data collection in this study included summer 2016 through summer 2020. Restoration began in December 2017 and was completed in February 2019. After restoration, abundance and NCBI values increased at all sub-watersheds. For the development sub-watershed, taxa richness was significantly different after restoration with averages increasing from 5-8 taxa and abundance was significantly different with averages increasing from 29 to 87 total organisms after restoration. For the agricultural sub-watershed, taxa richness was significantly different after restoration with averages decreasing from 10 to 8 taxa, EPT richness was significantly different after restoration with averages decreasing from 4 to 3 taxa, and the NCBI score was significantly different after restoration with the average NCBI score increasing from 5.55 to 6.98 reflecting a change in water quality from ‘good-far’ to ‘poor’ after restoration. For the forested control sub-watershed, there was no change in taxa richness (13 taxa), EPT richness (6 taxa), abundance (58 total organisms), and NCBI score (4.65/Good) after restoration. Changes in land-use led to different patterns among biotic metrics that are sensitive to environmental variation such as taxa richness, EPT richness, and NCBI. During the time frame of this study, even though patterns were observed there were very few statistically significant differences that were contributed to the fact that the restoration project is still new (2-3 years depending on the site). Practitioners suggest it can take upwards of 10 years for a stream to recover after restoration. To correctly assess the outcome of stream restoration projects, multiple years of pre-restoration and post-restoration data are needed.",
"The Influence of Low-Income Households: Social Cohesion Entrepreneurship Formalization Moderated by Family Support, Risk Propensity, and Locus of Control","Wise, Janice",2021,"Poverty is a global problem dating back to the early nineteen hundred. Issues, such as income inequalities, food insecurities, poor education, lack of good health care, and housing challenges have often been highlighted in the research. The plight of low-income households remains an important topic. Prior research shows entrepreneurship as a possible answer but how could low-income households take advantage of the opportunity that entrepreneurship provides? Researchers have also shown that a high percentage of low-income households engage in informal entrepreneurship because of the low cost of entry. Not all low-income households that are entrepreneurs practice in the informal sector. Thus, what are factors that contribute to low-income households’ participation in the formalization of entrepreneurship? This dissertation empirically investigates the relationship between social cohesion and the degree of entrepreneurship formalization of low-income households. It further studies the moderating variables family support, risk propensity, and locus of control. The findings suggest that social cohesion has a substantial influence on the degree of entrepreneurship formalization, but family support and locus of control do not moderate the relationship. However, risk propensity has a significant negative effect on the relationship between social cohesion and the degree of entrepreneurship formalization.",
"The Influences of Brand Personality, Culture, and Social Media on Iconic Brand Preferences","Whelan, Brian",2021,"Despite the strong appeal of iconic brands, research on how consumers form attachments and loyalty to them has been limited. To fill this knowledge gap, this research is aimed at identifying factors that may determine consumers’ emotional attachment and ensuing loyalty to iconic brands, focused on brand personality, cultural disposition, and social media activity as influencing factors. To accomplish this, a survey was administered on the general population available on Amazon Mechanical Turk (Mturk) (n=759). Empirical results from a multi-level linear regression model indicates that brand personality, cultural disposition and social media activity influence both loyalty and attachment to iconic brands. Detailed findings are presented. Lastly, theoretical and managerial implications, limitations and future research directions are discussed.

"The Interactive Effect of Psychological Capital and Gender on Employee Turnover and Promotion Within Entrepreneurial Ventures","Tuders, John",2021,"Entrepreneurship is drives economic growth and innovation. While research largely focuses on the role of the individual entrepreneur, new venture success also depends on the ability for the entrepreneur to attract and retain employees. The purpose of this study investigates if an applicant expressed Psychological Capital (PsyCap) level could have an impact on employee turnover and/or promotion events within the environment of a new entrepreneurial venture, and how this relationship is moderated by employee gender. This study consists of 174 hired employees over a six-year period of initial growth from a young digital-oriented new venture firm. All behavioral and demographic data was provided to further the research and understanding of how employee PsyCap measurement can help optimize hiring and retaining top talent. Overall, this study's findings offer opportunity to advance the knowledge of PsyCap and the longer-term positive impact it can have on employees within entrepreneurial ventures, and the importance of being exposed to the PsyCap individual measurement as early in the hiring or onboarding timeframe as possible. This study brings three main contributions to the literature. First, this dissertation adds to the minimal stream of research that currently exists at the intersection of human resources and entrepreneurship. Second, this study expands current PsyCap literature by leveraging its usability to understanding entrepreneurial employees. The third contribution comes in expanding the potential use of content text analysis during the hiring process for new ventures.",
"The Predictors of Counselor Moral and Ethical Reflection: Spiritual Intelligence, Meditation, Clinical Experience, and Ethical Climate","Nelson, Christie",2021,"While research on the ethical decision-making process in counseling continues to evolve, ethical violations committed by counselors persist, evidenced by an increase in the number of adverse incidents resulting in closed insurance claims and millions of dollars paid to the public on behalf of counselors (Healthcare Providers Service Organization, 2019). Knowledge of ethical codes and legal statutes, along with available decision-making models alone have been insufficient in guiding counselors’ ethical decision-making (Burns, 2019; Burns & Cruikshanks, 2019; Lambie et al., 2010; Lambie et al., 2011). Other factors must be considered to better understand this complex process. The purpose of this study was to examine how spiritual intelligence, meditation practice, clinical experience, and ethical climate were related to moral and ethical reflectivity among counselors in North Carolina. A standard multiple linear regression was utilized to examine the role of counselors’ (n = 700) spiritual intelligence, meditation practice, clinical experience, and quality of the ethical climate to predict their moral and ethical reflection. Results indicated that spiritual intelligence, meditation, and ethical climate were significantly positively correlated to moral and ethical reflection. Additionally, the model accounted for 12% of the variance in moral and ethical reflection. Implications for the field of counseling are discussed.",
"The Use of Lidar Point Cloud Data for Facilities Management","Poulos, George",2021,"ABSTRACTGEORGE POULOS. The Use of LiDAR Point Clouds for University Facilities Management (Under the direction of Dr. Glenda Mayo) The use of 3D LiDAR technology has been consistently in demand. 3D scans are used for many different applications including documenting assets and creating as-built drawing of current buildings. However, a significant hurdle is that there is no industry standard or recommended way of using the scan data. In this small case study, 50 buildings were scanned on the campus of The University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNC Charlotte). With this data, three methods were identified and used to present options to facility managers for how to make the scan data accessible to the employees that can use it in their work with operations and decision making. The identified methods were examined for applicability, cost, ease of use and overall effectiveness. Each method was presented to a small group of university facilities management representatives and a short survey was completed after the presentation. The survey data showed that most of the responses indicated that exploring the Scene 2go method could bring useful information to the department to support what 3D scanning can bring to UNC Charlotte. The research also helped to quantify scan times and data collection needs, which may also assist new users in the planning and implementation process for 3D scanning.",
"The contextual characteristics of violent crime against Native American women","Stanley, Michelle A.",2021,"National surveys, reports, and research articles have indicated that Native American women experience some of the highest rates of violence compared to women from other racial or ethnic groups in the United States. Despite these findings, there is a lack of in-depth research on the violence experienced by Native women. This study uses the concatenated incident dataset from the National Crime Victimization Survey for 1992-2019. The sample for this study included 6,139 female respondents who experienced violent crime from 2014-2019. The purpose of this study was to identify the contextual characteristics of violence against Native women and determine how these characteristics differ when compared to women from other racial groups. Findings from cross-tabulations suggest that Native American women experience high rates of assault and that the contextual characteristics for all violence differ when compared to Black, White, Asian, and women from other racial groups. The findings of a cluster analysis identified ten sub-groups of Native women. Five of the clusters included women who experienced high levels of assault, one cluster was composed of women who only experienced robbery, and four clusters included women who experienced higher rates of rape or sexual assault. Across all clusters, Native women were more likely to experience violence from interracial offenders, live in urban areas, and be unmarried. There were also variations in contextual characteristics between clusters. Importantly, this study provides visibility for violence against Native women; includes discussions of settler colonialism, sovereignty, and Federal Indian Laws; and highlights implications for public administrators.

"The development of Chinese overseas joint venture universities and their role in Chinese higher education","Mao, Ping",2021,"This dissertation investigates a newly emerging phenomenon in Chinese higher education in which a Chinese university partners with an overseas university to open a new university campus in China which began in 2004. This form of university was established in the context of economic growth and education reform in Chinese society. It has brought a change to the rebuilding of nonpublic higher education in China since the late 1980s. It also reinforces the emphasis on internationalization and diversification of higher education set by Chinese government for the 21st century. However, as a joint venture in higher education, this form of education is still unknown to many education scholars with respect to its formation mechanisms and motivations. Moreover, given the changing landscape of Chinese higher education, the current status and future prospects of this type of university are worthy of study considering its benefits as well as challenges for Chinese and the global higher education development. What is more, the social, economic, and policy implications of these universities are even more enormous than its education perspective. This dissertation is an exploratory case study involving intensive interviews with seven administrators and nine students from four institutions in this study along with content analysis of mission statements and school documents involving all nine institutions in this group. Findings suggest that the emergence of joint venture universities is consistent with the growing trend of globalization and internationalization in worldwide higher education development. Motivations and goals of institutions in pursuing this cooperation may vary among countries. China’s governmental involvement in this kind of education signifies a new trend in higher education collaboration that incorporates governmental interest in political, economic, and global pursuits rather than focusing on the education per se. Thus, this type of joint venture universities is neither public nor private. An unexpected finding is that the emergence of this form of education did not improve education inequality existing in Chinese higher education due to geographical location but reinforce the reproduction of inequality. Also, the small number of special joint venture universities in China seem to aim more for advancing China’s international goals to engage on the global stage, foster China’s active globalization efforts, and prepare Chinese students to be academically and socially ready for globalization. These findings thus have substantial implications for policymakers in relevant areas and help them in policymaking decisions.",
"The in-vivo Evolution of Burkholderia multivorans in a Cystic Fibrosis patient","Harrison, Sarah",2021,"ABSTRACT Burkholderia multivorans is an opportunistic pathogen that poses a health risk to patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The use of broad-range antibiotics to combat chronic bacterial lung infections has led to the evolution of antibiotic-resistant and multi-drug resistant Burkholderia multivorans (ABR and MDR). Understanding how these bacteria respond genetically to antibiotic therapy would be useful in optimizing drug therapy as well as to provide insight into how an established, complex, and chronic bacterial community adapts in response to multiple drug treatments. To this extent, we analyzed the in vivo evolution of B. multivorans during multiple pulmonary exacerbations over three years in a CF patient who underwent extensive antibiotic treatment. We found the population diversified into at least two coexisting lineages with an average of 2.7 SNPs/year. Within these lineages, we found that 12 genes had a significant excess of mutations. Importantly, we observed an excess of mutations in the dacB gene and one in ampD, in strains isolated following IV administration of ceftazidime (CAZ) during a 2-week hospitalization. Both dacB and ampD have previously been reported to regulate β-lactamase expression, where deactivating mutants leads to hyper-inducible AmpC and/or PenA in other Burkholderia and gram-negative bacteria. These data suggest possible β-lactamase regulators' importance to resistance to β-lactam antibiotics in B. multivorans.",
"The local and landscape features associated with roost attendance and nesting success in urban black vulture (Coragyps atratus) and turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) populations.","Partridge, Hannah",2021,"Land cover changes that result from increasing urbanization alter habitat type, structure, and resource availability on local and global scales. Vultures provide important ecosystem services including disease management and nutrient cycling, making them an important feature of urban areas. For vultures, urbanization may have both positive and negative impacts, such as increased foraging opportunities due to the presence of roadkill and decreased nesting success due to human presence, complicating our understanding of the effect of urbanization on these essential species. I examined how local and landscape features affect roost attendance and nesting success of black vultures (Coragyps atratus) and turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) in the Charlotte Metropolitan Area, USA. I counted the number of vultures at twenty-nine permanent roost sites once a month between November 2019-March 2020 and November 2020-March 2021 and monitored the nesting activities and periods once a week between March and August 2020 at two rural black vulture nests and one urban black vulture nest. At each roosting site, I characterized vegetation height, roost height, right-of-way corridor width, and weather conditions, and measured land cover, carcass density, and Developed-Forest edge density in the surrounding landscape within radii ranging from 0.4km to 20km. I tested the effects of these variables on the number of vultures at roosts using generalized linear models and multi-model inference. The best model for roost attendance included the date, wind speed, corridor edge vegetation height, carcass density within 15km and 20km of roosts, Developed land cover within 15km of roosts, and Developed-Forest edge density within 15km of roosts. Of these variables, Developed land cover was associated with higher numbers of vultures while all other variables were associated with lower roost attendance. The two rural black vulture nests each successfully fledged two young whereas the urban nest failed with no eggs hatched. The rural black vulture nests each had much less developed landcover and more forested landcover surrounding the site, potentially representing negative impacts of developed land cover on vulture nesting success. The negative effect of carcass density on vulture numbers suggests more reliance of vultures on trash and other anthropogenic food sources. The change in urban vulture diets may have important implications for urban systems, altering nutrient cycling within ecosystems and decreasing the reproductive success of urban vultures.",
"Thermo-Fluid and Mechanical Design and Optimization Of An Advanced Printed Circuit Heat Exchanger For Supercritical CO2 Brayton Cycles","Khalesi, Javad",2021,"A supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) Brayton power cycle is considered as one of the promising energy conversion systems for a number of applications such as advanced nuclear reactors, advanced fossil, and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants due to its high thermodynamic efficiency and small equipment size (heat exchangers and turbomachinery). The compact heat exchangers such as Printed Circuit Heat Exchangers (PCHEs) with micro-channel geometry are suitable for coupling different heat sources such as nuclear reactor to a sCO2 Brayton power cycle. PCHEs offer very high specific heat transfer area and pressure containment and are typically fabricated using chemical etching and diffusion bonding process [1]. Conventional semi-circular micro-channel PCHEs are used for recuperators and general use heat exchangers. The objective of this study is to design and optimize an advanced PCHE micro-channel geometry and topology for a sCO2 Brayton cycle. This work is concerned with the design where both sides of the plate are etched forming a double-etched micro-channel design configuration. In this advanced micro-channel topology, shim plates are needed to construct a PCHE stack using diffusion bonding. The design goals are to maximize heat transfer, minimize pressure drop, improve thermal performance and reduce the size, while maintaining mechanical integrity of a PCHE. Thermo-hydraulic performance of semi-circular micro-channel and advanced semi-circular and circular double-etched micro-channel geometries, i.e., the Nusselt number and Fanning Friction Factor (friction coefficient) and the overall heat transfer coefficient U between the hot and cold channels, pressure drop, and maximum stress, were determined and are reported in this work. The results obtained for the advanced double-etched microchannel geometry were compared to the ""conventional"" semi-circular single-etched (single-side etched) micro-channel design for the counter-flow arrangement. Using ANSYS-Workbench, a multi-objective optimization algorithm employing NSGA-II and Response Surface Approximation (RSA) as a surrogate model was used for design and optimization of the advanced double-etched micro-channel PCHE geometry. The channel fin, the channel pitch, and shim plate thickness were the parameters used in optimization. Alloys 617 and 230 were used as materials of construction.",
"This Generation Will Not Pass Away Before All These Things Take Place","Cataldo, Ryan",2021,"This study examines the apocalyptic expectation of Jesus’ imminent return from heaven in the early Jesus movement, and how Matthew and Mark respond to its failure by recasting it as fulfilled. Jesus’ return from heaven, also known as the Parousia, was expected to be a literal event that would happen soon and would be directly and universally experienced (according to the descriptions in Paul’s epistles). In response to the Parousia failing to take place, Mark and Matthew reinterpret the expectation of Jesus’ return and tie it explicitly to the events surrounding the destruction of the Jewish Temple by the Romans—which turns a failure into a fulfillment. I focus mostly on the ""Synoptic Apocalypse"" passage in Mark 13, its expanded version in Matthew 24, and related materials in chapters 23-25. By comparing the close thematic language parallels to earlier apocalyptic materials in Paul’s first letter to the Thessalonians and in the Deutero-Pauline letter of 2 Thessalonians, I argue that Mark and Matthew explicitly tie the ""Parousia and the end of the age"" to the events surrounding the destruction of Jerusalem. In the Synoptic Apocalypse passage, they both use the apocalyptic and heavenly language metaphorically to describe the Roman destruction of Jerusalem. In doing so, they spiritualize Jesus’ return, which expected earlier by Paul to be something more literal. I also look at two of Matthew’s eschatological parables and his redactions of Mark 13, which strengthen this interpretative connection between the destruction of Jerusalem and the Parousia.",
"Through the Lens of Social Movement Impact Theory in Latin America. Measuring Social Entrepreneurial Intention: Utilizing Socio-Political Activism and Entrepreneurial Passion as Moderated by Opportunity Recognition and Gender","Darden, Bryan",2021,"Many studies have used the Theory of Planned Behavior to explain social entrepreneurial intention; however, limited empirical research has focused on the effects that socio-political activism, theory of social movements, and social movement impact theory have had on social entrepreneurship and the motivation of experienced entrepreneurs to become social entrepreneurs. More interestingly, the extant literature has infrequently explored Latin America's role and how Latin American entrepreneurs who have social entrepreneurial interests create social ventures. I examined factors leading to increased social entrepreneurial intention using social movement impact theory as a basis for identifying antecedents; I used social roles theory to explain the role that gender plays in this movement. Utilizing socio-political activism and entrepreneurial passion as independent variables, I explored the moderating effects of entrepreneurial opportunity recognition and gender to explain the variance within social entrepreneurial intention. My study focused on experienced Latin American entrepreneurs (n = 305), one of few studies to do so. Hypotheses were tested utilizing hierarchical multiple regression. The research suggests significant associations that predict social entrepreneurial intentions, including socio-political activity and entrepreneurial passion. My research makes multiple contributions to the literature. I incorporated three major entrepreneurial fields: entrepreneurial passion, entrepreneurial opportunity, and entrepreneurial intention. I also explored the moderating effects of gender and integrated multiple gender categories into a conceptual model. Utilizing hierarchical multiple regression, the model explained 33% (R² .33) of the variance of social entrepreneurial intention. Over 100 antecedents have been tested. Few extant studies have considered social entrepreneurial intention, by way of social theory, to understand what motivates social entrepreneurs. By incorporating social movement impact theory, social roles theory, and multiple entrepreneurial fields, researchers can better understand social entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurial intention.",
"Towards Adapting Cognitive Architectures for Knowledgeable & Personalized Dialogue Systems","Santhanam, Sashank",2021,"State-of-the-art conversational agents have advanced significantly in conjunction with the use of large transformer-based language models. However, even with these rapid advancements, the current generation of conversational agents suffers from three major problems: (i) long-term context modeling; (ii) producing informative and factually accurate responses; (iii) robust evaluation of the NLG systems. Our work tackles these three gaps: (i) To address the issue of long-term context modeling, we present a novel end-to-end approach inspired by neurocognitive memory processes. We also implement a novel action selection mechanism that helps identify the relevant utterances containing salient information from long-term memory to working memory to better incorporate the context of the conversation during the generation process than state-of-the-art systems. (ii) To integrate knowledge into conversational agents, we also propose a dialog framework that incorporates both local knowledge as well as users' past dialogues to generate high-quality personalized conversations. Using our framework, we demonstrate that incorporating local knowledge can largely improve \emph{informativeness}, \emph{coherency} and \emph{realisticness} measures using human evaluations. However, even with these advancements, we find that knowledge grounded conversation models are prone to hallucinations. We address this issue by proposing a new dataset called ``CONV-FEVER'' to build a fact consistency detector. We show that our detector outperforms the current SOTA and can be integrated with existing models to increase the factual consistency of the knowledge grounded models. (iii) In the last part of this thesis, we focus on the aspect of the impact of experiment design in conversational AI systems by conducting two large-scale studies. In the first study, we compare four different experimental designs and study how each experiment design affects the quality of outputs obtained from the human evaluation. In the second study, we study the impact of cognitive biases particularly anchoring bias, and demonstrate its impact on human evaluation of NLG systems.",
"Towards ai-empowered wireless networks: from edge to core","janakaraj, prabhu",2021,"Wireless multi-hop networks have been widely exploited for deploying cost-efficient network backbones including wireless community mesh networks, high-speed urban networks, global wireless internet infrastructure, battlefield networks, and public safety/disaster rescue networks. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technology for next-generation AI systems that can collaboratively improve a shared global model while preserving user privacy and encompassing users at a larger-scale. FL systems are designed to be used on Single-hop wireless networks which consists of edge servers that are connected to the high-speed internet core. Enabling FL over wireless multi-hop networks can democratize AI and make it accessible in a cost-effective manner. However, our preliminary study found that FL over wireless multi-hop networks possess significant challenges due to the presence of multiple noisy interference-rich wireless links which not only slows the learning process due to the underlying communication delay but also leads to nomadic model updates. The inherent bottleneck for FL over wireless multi-hop networks are (1) One-size-for-all model deployment and training, where each edge device process the same number of local iterations for model updates (2) Model-based optimization is not feasible for multi-hop FL, since FL performance metrics cannot be formulated as a closed-form function for network control parameters such as packet forwarding decision and transmission power for each router. In this thesis, we proposed a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) empowered wireless network systems that can guarantee stability, high accuracy, and faster convergence speed by taming communication latency, system heterogeneity, and statistical heterogeneity. Towards this goal (1) We have developed a Programmable Wireless Network Operating System (WINOS), which allows the user to implement AI routing solutions (2) We have developed a novel Hierarchical Synchronous FL system architecture that can maximize communication efficiency in addition to tolerating stragglers for non-blocking executions (3) We have implemented a naturally federated application, Gait based user authentication and recognition mechanism using millimeter wave, which is one of the privacy-preserving biometric authentication mechanism (4) We have developed a novel domain adaptation solutions that helps in applying FL system trained in single domain to different domains that possess spatial variations. Finally, our experimentation result shows that AI enabled wireless networked systems are extremely efficient in handling heterogeneity and communication latency, surpassing the traditional network systems performance.",

"Underground Circles and Clandestine Romance: Queer Resistance under the Third Reich","Roberson, Keira",2021,"This study proposes a framework through which to examine queer resistance and oppositional behaviors under oppression and persecution, such as the Nazi regime. Under the Weimar Republic, queer circles coalesced into communities that developed a degree of visibility in the German public and political discourse. Queer activists advocated for the abolition of Paragraph 175, the section of the German legal code which criminalized homosexual intercourse. Immediately following the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933, the Nazi German government targeted the visible queer establishments and print outlets. In 1935, the Nazi regime revised Paragraph 175 to implement harsher penalties and expand the scope of its homosexual criminalization. This study examines the clandestine queer communities that moved outside the public sphere to both preserve their own safety and resist Nazi persecution. Queer circles developed underground networks to maintain a semblance of their Weimar-era communities and engage in explicitly illegal acts of sexual autonomy. Furthermore, queer individuals engaged in tactics to preserve the safety of their networks and immediate queer circles.",
"Understanding and Designing for Sharing and Privacy in Wearable Fitness Platforms","Alqhatani, Abdulmajeed",2021,"Commercial wearable devices that collect health and fitness data are widely used. These devices sense and collect a variety of personal data, which can be shared by users with other people and with third parties. Yet, the collection of personal data by these sensor devices and the sharing of it poses several risks, including stalking, secondary use, aggregation, and inferences. In this dissertation, I present a detailed understanding of fitness tracker users’ sharing practices, concerns, awareness, and needs. The main goal is to design controls and features that empower users over the sharing and privacy of their information. My research utilized different approaches, including semi- structured interview, survey, and participatory design studies. Overall, the findings uncover several sharing patterns by fitness tracker users, with practices in each pattern based on the intended audiences. While users do not consider much of the data collected by their devices sensitive, they have concerns about the possibility of abusing their data. However, users have limited awareness about the potential to infer personal information from the primary data collected by activity trackers. My research provides several factors that might impact users’ perceptions and attitudes towards inferences in the context of IoT wearable devices. Lastly, my research presents a set of taxonomies for sharing and privacy controls and mechanisms in fitness tracker platforms and contributes several design guidelines.",

"Using Narrative Advising Theory in Interpreting the Roles of Advisors and Guides in African American Young Adult Literature","Kelley, Gina",2021,"Telling stories has been a popular method of how humans connect interactively and serve a purpose to educate, entertain, influence, warn, and illustrate. In African-American young adult (YA) literature, there are guides that dish out valuable advice or stories of their own that carries a vital amount of weight and significantly impact the protagonists’ life. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the role of guides in African-American YA literature and their impact on the protagonist as it correlates to the realistic roles of academic advisors and their influence on the students by utilizing narrative advising theory practices.",
"Volume Microenvironment Self-Consistent Constraint Theory Applied to Protein Stability Prediction","Johannessen, Nicholas",2021,"Controlling thermodynamic stability is a challenge in protein engineering. Engineering a protein by introducing mutations into its sequence to increase efficacy can destabilize the protein thermodynamically, preventing it from functioning in its intended environment. Having a rapid computational method to accurately estimate the stability of protein mutants will accelerate the design process. A minimal Distance Constraint Model (DCM) has been extensively used in previous works to predict thermodynamic stability in proteins by employing network rigidity as an underlying long-range mechanical interaction between constituent parts of a protein. This novel graph-theoretical approach also provides stability-flexibility relationships in proteins to elucidate functional mechanisms. The minimal DCM invokes microenvironment-independent parameters for energy and entropy contributions due to atomic packing, and partially models the microenvironment variation in hydrogen bond interactions. Three phenomenological parameters were employed to compensate for model oversimplifications. A new DCM is developed in this thesis with three major extensions – the rigidity model for molecular interactions is generalized, the microenvironment for all molecular interactions are quantified through local molecular volume properties, and self-consistent constraint theory is implemented. This new DCM captures cold and heat denaturation, although the free energy basin for low temperature denaturation is not accessible. It is found that the template structure used to model intramolecular interactions must deviate significantly from the input crystal structure where volume information of the native protein fold is no longer relevant. Feasibility of this new DCM is demonstrated, and the current implementation is ready to be fully parameterized over a large experimental dataset.",
"What is in my Patient's Pantry? Addressing Food Insecurity in Primary Care: a Quality Improvement Project","Koontz, Rachel",2021,"Food insecurity (FI) has negative health effects throughout the lifespan, yet there is a disconnect between national recognition of FI as a health issue and FI screening in the clinical setting. The purpose of this project was to determine if an educational intervention increased knowledge of FI’s role on health, the screening and referral process, and using ICD-10 coding to document FI. A pretest-posttest design was used, sampling clinicians across five clinical sites. Participants received virtual education and completed a pre-, post-, and 3-month follow-up survey to measure knowledge, attitudes, and willingness to address FI issues. A retrospective ICD-10 coding report for FI was obtained to measure frequency of use per clinic site. Thirty-one clinicians completed the pre- and post-survey, and twelve clinicians completed all three time points. Participants’ knowledge of FI and knowledge of referral resources was significantly improved from the pre- to post-survey (p < .0001, p < .0000 respectively). Clinicians showed a significant change in their intent to ask patients about FI (p < .0000) and to refer patients to community food resources (p < .0000); this remained at the 3-month follow-up (p < .008, p < .001). There was not a significant change in the use of the ICD-10 code for FI throughout the measurement period. The results of this project support findings in the literature that a point-in-time educational training on FI could improvement clinicians’ knowledge, as well as their willingness to screen patients for FI and connect them to food resources.",
"Why Some Stay When So Many Leave: A Phenomenological Study on Why Teachers Remain in Low-Income, High-Minority Schools","Hovis, Michael",2021,"Tens of thousands of teachers in the United States leave their schools to work in other occupations or other schools each year. This has earned the teaching profession the reputation of being a ""revolving door,"" with a large number of qualified teachers leaving the profession prior to retirement. A wealth of literature has been devoted to understanding factors that lead to teacher attrition; however, little attention has been given to understanding the factors affecting why teachers remain in low-income, high-minority schools.This qualitative transcendental phenomenological study was to determine the lived experiences that keep six elementary school teachers teaching in low-income, high-minority schools when so many of their peers chose to leave. This study attempted to look through the lens of elementary-level school teachers who have stayed in low-income, high-minority schools for 5 years or more. This study was guided by four research questions: What do teachers who stay in predominantly low-income, high-minority public elementary schools identify as obstacles to their longevity? What specific practices and strategies do teachers who work in low-income, high-minority public elementary schools utilize to support their longevity in these schools? How do the teachers’ overall experiences and understanding of predominantly low-income, high-minority public elementary schools affect their decisions to stay? and How do teachers’ experiences working in predominantly low-income, high-minority public elementary schools transform their opinions of perceived obstacles to their longevity and their ability to adapt to address the perceived obstacles?The findings of this study suggest that the participants’ lived experiences within their own personal educational experience or their professional teaching experience transformed their desire to stay in a low-income, high-minority school setting. Furthermore, the findings suggest that when a participant had a good experience within their professional teaching experience due to working conditions or administrative support, that would in turn give the participant’s students a good educational experience that would support academic growth and potentially a desire to go into the educational field. Low-income, high-minority schools present their own set of challenges and unique transitional stressors that are different from more low-poverty, low-minority schools. Teachers who work in these schools tend to leave more frequently and often than their peers who teach at schools that are more affluent. This study attempted to provide a deeper understanding in the hope to fill the gap in scholarly knowledge, while attempting to halt the ""revolving door.""",
"Why Waste? Local Factors And Recycling Outcomes: A Case Study Of North Carolina Counties","Fernandes, Titiksha",2021,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported that in 2015 only 67.8million tons or about 26% of the total waste generated was recycled, while the waste generated continued to rise. It is clear from the numbers above that the success of current recycling programs is limited. Increasing populations will continue to put pressure on our existing resources, compelling governments at all levels to take additional action to increase recycling efforts to transition from a linear model of make, use, and dispose to a closed-loop circular economy system, emphasizing reduce, reuse and recycle. Additional challenges arising from China’s National Sword Policy have further exacerbated the recycling crisis. Within this context, my research evaluates recycling programs at the county level in the state of North Carolina. The first part explores county level factors that affect recycling rates. Factors span across the economic, demographic, social, geographic, technical, and programmatic aspects of recycling programs. The second part of my study focusses on exploring the economic and environmental merits of recycling. Specifically, this section explores the GHG emissions and wage creation from recycling certain materials as compared to landfilling them, and the causal mechanism between recycling, and GHG emissions and employment generation. Qualitative interviews with stakeholders in the recycling community inform the findings of my quantitative analysis. I found that recycling is moving away from being a behavior based on individual taste and preferences to a mainstream behavior—part of everyday life. We must view recycling not only as an individual altruistic action but also as a means to decrease the cost of goods, lower landfill costs, combat climate change, and reduce resource and energy use while engaging the community. Most important is the need for standardized measures for recycling, new ways to measure recycling performance, and greater consistency in solid waste management policies so that scholars and program analysts can conduct more comparative studies.",
"“It sometimes heals, but it sometimes hurts”; Exploring the issues facing first-generation and immigrant staff caring for immigrant youth in an after-school program","Cronin, Claire",2021,"Coming from countries across the world, immigrants have chosen to start a new life in the United States, and become part of the fabric that makes up American society. Today, immigrant children face a unique set of challenges and hardships including trauma, acculturative stress, and poverty. Helping to support their needs is a diverse workforce of helping professionals, providing support in a variety of settings. After-school programming has been utilized as a successful approach to supporting immigrant children, and by extension their families and communities. It is unique for children in after-school programs to be supported by staff that share similar lived experiences and ethnic backgrounds. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the issues facing first-generation and immigrant staff caring for immigrant youth in a supportive after-school program. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 8 participants via Zoom to facilitate in-depth descriptions of their perspectives. Six participants were interviewed twice over a period of six weeks to explore their experiences and perspectives across a time span during the Covid-19 pandemic. Two participants were interviewed once due to scheduling conflicts. The Pragmatic Qualitative Data Analysis (PQDA) method was utilized to analyze data from the interviews and observational field memos. A total of three major themes emerged from the data that included: (a) Emotional Labor, (b) Identity Development, and (e) Covid-19 Pandemic Impacts. This research found that there was a relationship between the central themes of emotional labor, Covid-19, and identity development. Participants’ experience of emotional labor created the unique space for employees to create and reinforce their own cultural identity, while being open and supportive to the various cultural identities. This sense of support from colleagues added a mediator which helped participants to cope with the stress of emotional labor and the Covid-19 pandemic. Other implications for counselors, organizations, policy and future research investigations are explored.",
"“Re-membering” History to Counter Miseducation: Explorations of Curriculum Development and Culturally Responsive Pedagogy in Urban Education","Teasdell, Annette",2021,"ABSTRACTANNETTE TEASDELL. ""Re-membering"" History to Counter Miseducation: Explorations of Curriculum Development and Culturally Responsive Pedagogy in Urban Education. (Under the direction of DR. GREG WIGGAN) Excellence in education is based on a curriculum that is true, relevant, and appropriate, and on educational processes that are humane and democratic. A pervasive problem in U.S. schools is a curriculum that perpetuates cultural hegemony, lacks multiple perspectives, and adheres to scripts to accommodate education policy. ""Re-membering"" history by producing and studying democratized knowledge can counter master narratives. Applying critical race theory and Afrocentricity, this research explores curriculum development, culturally responsive pedagogy, and student outcomes in the context of urban education. Using case study methodology, content analysis, and historical detection, this qualitative multiple article dissertation explores three curricular omissions that can expand multicultural education discourse. Findings show that culturally responsive pedagogy combined with a curriculum that is accurate, relevant, and appropriate can yield improved student outcomes. This has implications for practitioners and scholars in U.S. schools.

"“Redeeming"" the Canal, Centralizing the Nation: Omar Torrijos and the Quest for Panamanian Sovereignty","Winch, Debora",2021,"From October 1968 to September 1977, the Panamanian government under the leadership of Omar Torrijos Herrera conducted negotiations with the United States regarding the Panama Canal, controlled and established by the United States. This thesis seeks to evaluate the role of Torrijos's authoritarian populist leadership in the assertion of Panamanian sovereignty and the fight for the Panama Canal. It will also analyze the influence of Torrijos’s political style on diplomatic relations between the United States and Panama. The existing literature on Omar Torrijos and his populist leadership has neglected his role as an authoritative figure in the development of patriotism in Panamanian political culture in the years leading up to the Torrijos-Carter negotiations in 1977. This study examines primary sources from both Panama and the United States to analyze Torrijos’ authoritarian and populist efforts to expand the political involvement of groups within Panamanian society in order to gain possession of the Panama Canal and successfully complete negotiations with the United States.",
"“Seeing it in Action is More Beneficial Than Learning About it in School”: A Multi-Case of Clinical Experiences and Culturally Responsive Literacy Instruction","Schmidt, Leslie",2021,"This multiple case study explored the characteristics of clinical experiences that support preservice teachers' understandings of culturally responsive literacy in elementary classrooms. In particular, this study focused on capturing the voices and perspectives of three preservice teachers through semi-structured interviews, observations, and the collection of artifacts such as literacy lesson plans, journal entries, and photographs. Findings suggest that preservice teachers generally understand culturally responsive teaching as: (a) using a variety of diverse texts; (b) building a learning community that honors students’ cultures, (c) maintaining high expectations for all students; and (d) teachers knowing their students in order to connect the course content to their lives, cultures, and interests based on their coursework and experiences in the clinical setting. Data also showed that clinical educators are the most influential characteristic of preservice teachers’ understandings of culturally responsive literacy and being in the classroom setting is more influential than only learning about culturally responsive teaching through university coursework. Findings also indicate that preservice teachers are developing superficial understandings of culturally responsive teaching, suggesting implications for teacher education and preparation.",
"“We’re Not ‘Baby Daddies’ We Are Fathers. Dads.”: Nonresidential Fathers’ Online Stigma Management","Schambach, Emma",2021,"Family and stigma communication research have barely scratched the surface of the dynamic and diverse arrangements of stigma in the family context. Though some research has investigated the stigma surrounding nontraditional family structures (e.g., adoptive families, same-gender parents), some populations have been neglected. Specifically, the lack of focus on nonresidential fathers is a substantial oversight in academic research. This thesis examines how nonresidential fathers communicate online about the stigma they face. It sheds light on this population's stigma management strategies through a thematic analysis of public online forums written by nonresidential fathers. This study reveals that fathers participate in facework, stigma management, and community formation when communicating online about the stigma they face. The results of this study have implications for communication studies as a field and applications for the dissolution of stigma in social and legal contexts.",
