https://pages.charlotte.edu/connections/people/ababcoc3/,Audrey Babcock,Music,breathing contemporary opera historical music language Judaism music music history   musical theatre opera producer singing voice,"Audrey Babcock is an Assistant Professor of Voice in the Department of Music. She is an award-winning mezzo-soprano who has gained notoriety for her commanding, powerful performances as Carmen, her dark, hypnotic portrayals of Maddalena in Rigoletto, and her emotionally raw performances as Aldonza in The Man of La Mancha. As Carmen, Babcock made her French debut with the Festival Lyrique-en-Mer and has performed the role with companies such as Florentine Opera, Nashville Opera, Florida Grand Opera, New York City Opera, San Antonio Opera, Knoxville Opera, Opera Delaware, Toledo Opera, Anchorage Opera, Dayton Opera, Fort Worth Opera, Mill City Summer Opera, and Utah Festival Opera and most recently with Bar Harbor Music Festival where she completed her 115th performance of the fiercest of the Femme Fatales.    Babcock discerns her research focuses along two tracts; the physical mechanisms of the breathing apparatus as pertains to the act of singing and specific arenas of musical history. To the singing mechanism, Ms. Babcock’s research pertains to the pelvic floor, pelvic health, and its tangible use in partnership with the deconstruction of breath. She is unpacking the relationship of the pelvic diaphragm to the global singing instrument from laryngeal stabilization to simultaneous neurological calm and full-bodied sonic vitality. Embodying these tools, Babcock’s Masterclass series, The Full-Bodied Voice, has brought her to colleges and Young Artist programs across the US and abroad from Fort Worth Opera to California Institute of the Arts. The series, from inspiration to creation, directly addresses how life and society has retrained the perfect breath we were born to take. From the ancient traditions of Kundalini Yoga and other kinesthetic practices she takes these tools from practice to performance. Babcock’s other arena of research involves bringing historical music and language into a modern context investigating Sephardic music, the Ladino language, and music created prior to and through the diaspora (post expulsion from Spain). The cross-pollination of Arabic (Moorish), Catholic, and Jewish art and culture in Spain circa 1400 A.D., as well as the following aurally transmitted diasporic song tradition, are her specific focuses.  Having spent much time under the tutelage of the late Nico Castel (who wrote the first book of ladino songs widely available to the public), her first album, Songs for Carmen, was born. SFC, a concept album, recorded under her Hebrew name, Aviva, hinges on the legend that the original Carmen may have been a Sephardic Jew and not a Gypsy. Babcock’s concert series, Beyond Carmen, her work with the ensemble Flamenco Sephardit and her Choreopoem – Carmen; Shadow of my Shadow, are all beneficiaries and extensions of this life-long pursuit.

She subsequently worked as a bioinformatics analyst and programmer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. In 1999, she took a faculty position at Virginia Tech and was involved in the development of their Bioinformatics graduate programs and the initial formation of the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute. In 2005, she moved to UNC Charlotte. Her expertise is in genomic data analysis, visualization and integration with experience in analysis of next-gen sequencing data, genome assembly, comparative genomics, transcriptomics, molecular biophysics, and molecular modeling. Google Scholar Profile Research Description: Dr. Gibas’ current research is focused on development of automated methods for probe and target selection and microarray data analysis. Her research group is developing analytical methods that will take into account the biophysical properties of molecules involved in the array experiment. This work attempts to connect the real physical behavior of molecules to microarray experiment outcomes, and to eliminate confounding factors based on accurate models of molecular behavior. Microarrays are now so commonly used that providing new methods and standards for their use impacts broadly across many fields of molecular biology research. Long oligonucleotide microarrays the class of arrays that we are studying, are increasingly commonly used, and yet it is not known whether the parameters used to model hybridization reactions are valid in the microarray context. Complete hybridization of each target molecule to its intended probe is taken for granted, in a milieu where many competing binding scenarios may be equally valid. Dr. Gibas’ major funding is from the NIH; the project is titled “Biophysical Optimization of Oligonucleotide Microarrays”. Dr. Gibas’ other research interests include development of devices for measuring hybridization in real time, application of visual analytics approaches to comparative genomics, and development of accurate molecular diagnostics.

The alternative could be something akin to the extreme isolation experienced by Tom Hank’s character in the movie, “Castaway.”   Unless you’re comfortable engaging a soccer ball in daily discussions of your thoughts, your life events, and your ideas, you might otherwise consider the value of a knowledgeable other in your life. This site is devoted to the concept of interpersonal communication, and in particular, serves as a virtual megaphone for its author.  It will feature musings of linguistic and cultural significance in the University of Charlotte educational community.  I’ll periodically write about current events taking place within the Department of Languages and Culture Studies, the College of Education, the UNC Charlotte Campus, and across the globe! For this inaugural entry, and as a test case for the interactivity I’d like to promote here, I invite your thoughts on the following question:  Does studying / speaking a second (or third, or fourth) language enhance your interpersonal skills in your first language?  If you’re uncertain as to what constitutes “interpersonal skills,” then take a look a this List of Interpersonal Skills:  10 Must-have Attributes from the Udeym.com website. Holla back,"

Evidence supports operationalizing effective practice and knowledge in terms of observable teacher-student interactions. We can improve teacher-student interactions by providing teachers with explicit evaluations, feedback, and training. However, teacher improvement efforts must be supported by reliable, valid measurement and rigorous research designs. In my research program, I seek to 1) measure teachers’ practice of effective teacher-student interactions through observations that are reliable and valid, 2) measure teachers’ knowledge of effective interactions related to observed teacher practice and to student outcomes, and 3) identify processes that improve teachers’ practice and knowledge of effective teacher-student interactions in school contexts.

Specifically, he is in the process of developing a low-cost biomechanical ankle assessment tool for clinicians and developing low-cost gait retraining instruments. Overall, his goal is to improve function and quality of life over the long term in patients with CAI and to develop prevention strategies that can be implemented in youth sports and in the general population to reduce the injury rates of lateral ankle sprains.

Research Statement: Dr. Howden’s research program focuses on genetic control of cardiopulmonary function at baseline and under specific environmental conditions.  Further, Dr. Howden is investigating the mechanisms associated with isometric exercise training induced reductions in human resting blood pressure. Baseline cardiopulmonary function Little is known about the likely complex nature of the genetic influence on cardiopulmonary control.  Dr. Howden has developed a model for assessing baseline cardiopulmonary function from quiescent, unrestrained, conscious mice.  In this model, electrocardiographic (ECG) is recorded by radio telemetry and pulmonary function by whole body plethysmgraphy, simultaneously.  Coupling this animal model with available genetic tools, Dr. Howden has identified a number of potential candidate genes.  We have identified a region (QTL) on mouse chromosome 6 that associates with between mouse strain differences in baseline heart rate (Figure 1).  We are currently investigating the genetic effect of this QTL on baseline heart rate.   Figure 1. Genome-wide linkage map for baseline heart rate in 28 AXB/BXA RI strains. The X axis represents the length of the each chromosome, the left Y axis shows the Likelihood Odds Ratio. (LOD; blue line), and the right Y axis shows the degree to which either A/J (green line) or B6 (red line; parental strains) alleles increase phenotypic values. The numbers along the top of the graph indicate chromosome number. The lower horizontal line indicates suggestive linkage and the upper horizontal line indicates significant (P < 0.05) linkage. Adapted from Howden et al. (2008) Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 295(1), H59 – 68. Hyperoxia-induced cardiopulmonary responses Prolonged hyperoxia (100% oxygen) exposure is an established animal model for Acute Lung Injury, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Bronchpulmonary Dysplasia.  However, little is known about the role of the cardiovascular system in the adverse outcomes associated with these diseases.  Using similar tools to those described above, continuous cardiopulmonary function can be recorded during hyperoxia exposure of genetic reference animal populations to describe the genetic contribution to exposure-induced responses.   We have identified a region (QTL) on mouse chromosome 9 that associates with between mouse strain differences in heart rate responses to hyperoxia exposure (Figure 2).  We are currently investigating the genetic effect of this QTL on baseline heart rate.   Figure 2. Genome-wide linkage map for heart rate responses to hyperoxia exposure in 28 AXB/BXA RI strains.

Impaired skeletal muscle regeneration is one component of sarcopenia. Notch and Wnt signaling are suggested to be dysfunctional during regeneration of aged skeletal muscle. It is of interest to determine the effect of models of biological muscle injury (physiological stimuli) on Notch and Wnt signaling during aged skeletal muscle repair. Dr. Arthur’s research agenda consists of examining the influence of Notch and Wnt signaling during repair of aged skeletal muscle that was exposed to physiological stimuli (exercise, muscle lengthening, hypertrophy). In addition, Dr. Arthur is investigating the interaction of Notch and Wnt signaling with muscle proteins that may be important for myogenesis (Msx1 Foxk1). In a collaboration with Appalachian State (Kevin Zwetsloot and Andy Shanely) Dr. Arthur and their team are studing the effect of the naturally-produced phytoecdysteroids from Ajuga turkestanica as a countermeasure against sarcopenia.

He completed a post-doctoral fellowship in the Department of Physiology at Dartmouth Medical School and held teaching and research positions at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. He joined the UNC Charlotte faculty in 1991 as a member of the Department of Psychology, and subsequently served as Faculty Associate in the Office of the Provost (2000-2001), Interim Associate Dean of the Graduate School (2001-2002), and founding chair of the Department of Public Health Sciences (2002-2010). Dr. Harver’s research program results from a blend of training and interests in experimental psychology, respiratory physiology, and pulmonary medicine. His work examines the perception of dyspnea and the impact of symptoms on the management of obstructive lung disease. He has published 2 books and over 60 book chapters and journal articles; and presented about 150 abstracts, talks, and workshops at regional, national, and international scientific meetings. He has consistently involved students at all levels – high school, undergraduate, master’s, and doctoral – in his research activities. Harver maintains keen interest in research ethics and scientific integrity; the university initially secured Federal-Wide Assurance for the Protection of Human Subjects in Research in 2001 during his term as Chair of the Institutional Review Board for Research with Human Subjects. A Faculty Associate with the Center for Professional and Applied Ethics since 2002, he currently serves as a campus mediator through the University Ombuds Office. Harver was an invited member of the American Thoracic Society Committee on Dyspnea (1995-1998), elected Chair-elect and Chair of the Program Committee for the Behavioral Science Assembly (1998-2000), and selected for the ATS Membership Committee (2001-2003). He has been appointed to the Editorial Boards of the AAEEBL ePortfolio Review (current), Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback, Chest, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health (current), Journal of Asthma (current), and Scientific World Journal.

I have realized that the development of healthy lifestyles often begins at infancy and continues through the stages of life (i.e. infancy, childhood, adolescence, early adulthood, adulthood, and older adult), thus it is crucial to understand health differences across the lifespan. In an attempt to better explain the multiple determinants associated with a specific condition, my research agenda integrates a life course approach to the study of chronic diseases and contributes to the advancement of my expertise in the field. Several chronic conditions have been linked, in part, to fetal environment, which include the following: hypertension, type 2 diabetes, asthma, prostate cancer, obesity, cognition, and stroke.

I am an internationally recognized expert on active life expectancy, a central public health indicator that measures life expectancy and the proportions of life with and without disability or disease. The United States and countries throughout the world use active life expectancy to assess population health, and to develop and evaluate health policies. Researchers throughout the world use methods that I helped to develop to study active life expectancy, which use panel survey data combined with Markov models and microsimulation. Microsimulation creates simulated populations that mirror the characteristics of actual populations. With the simulated populations researchers can follow individuals and groups throughout life. This provides new knowledge about the dynamics of health and disability, as well as factors that may help to increase access to health care, address health disparities, and promote well-being. Microsimulation addresses complex research questions that cannot be studied effectively using more conventional methods. My current research examines life expectancy, active life expectancy, disability, chronic disease, and developmental disability using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID, 1968-present), the longest running household survey in the world. These data allow me to follow individuals through all life stages, and families both across households and through several generations. I have published more than 150 peer-reviewed research studies, and have mentored students as coauthors on more than half of those publications. My CV includes my publications. I am a Fellow of the Gerontological Society of America. I serve on the Editorial Boards of: Disability and Health Journal, Journal of Women & Aging, and Journals of Gerontology Social Sciences. My research has been funded by the National Institute on Aging, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Health Resources and Services Administration. I have substantial professional practice experience in both public health and the personal health care system. I have supervised numerous program evaluations for public health agencies, schools of medicine, and health care organizations. In academic leadership, I led Master of Health Administration (MHA) Programs, 2003 to 2011, as the MHA Program Director, mentored more than 650 graduate students of health administration, and led successful re-accreditation initiatives involving the Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education (CAHME) at the University of South Carolina (2005) and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (2010). I have mentored more than 45 doctoral students in research. I received an A.B. from Colgate University, an A.A.S. (Registered Nursing), from SUNY Morrisville, a B.P.S. (Health Services Management) from SUNY Polytechnic Institute, an M.B.A. (Finance) from the Whitman School of Management at Syracuse University, and an M.A. (Economics) and a Ph.D. (Public Administration) from the Maxwell School at Syracuse University.
