Her work has also appeared in such scholarly journals as Reformation, Sixteenth Century Journal, and Reformation and Renaissance Review, and she is the author of chapters in major Art History publications such as The Primacy of the Image in Northern European Art, 1400-1700 (Leiden: Brill, 2017), Lucas Cranach der Jüngere und die Reformation der Bilder (München: Hirmer, 2015), and The Oxford Encyclopedia of Aesthetics, 2 nd edition (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2014).

Grimm Prize, for the best article published in the previous year in the international field of Reformation Germany.

Dr. Noble teaches upper-level classes in Northern Renaissance, Northern Baroque, and Gothic periods, as well as introductory surveys of Art History from the stone age to the twentieth century. Her current book project, provisionally called, “Mimesis, Melancholia and Misapprehension,” explores the intersection of representational techniques such as linear perspective with the rise of depictions of Melancholia and anxieties about visual perception.
